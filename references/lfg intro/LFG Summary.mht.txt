-computationally precise
-psychologically realistic representation
-no movement
-subject and object are primitives
"syntax is not based only on structure"=P&P multiple levels of representation
-began in 1970s by Joan Bresnan and Ronald Kaplan, they disputed the chomskyan transformational views (1982) arguing that it didnt have means to model the psychological
-"framework should be typologically grounded" (?!) argument: syntactic theory is based on compairisons between very similar languages



-multiple levels of representation each has
	-architecture
	-vocabulary
	-constraints
-levels not "derived" from each other (as compaired to P&P)
-levels are parallel
-levels are linked through mappings constrained by correspondance principles (which ensure the information on differnet levels is compatible)

LEVELS
dealing with syntactic analysis
-f(unctional)-structure
	-input comes from information encoded in lexical items or from information ni the nodes of c-structure
	-internal or 'covert' structure of language where grammatical relations are represented.
	-formlized by a matrix of attributes associated with values. matrixes can be viewed as mathematical function mapping the atributes to the values
	-restricted by completenes, coherence and uniqueness principles
-c(onstituent)-structure
-a(rgument)-structure

dealing witth logic semantic interpretation, sound systems and discourse pragmatics
-semantic(s)-structure
-phonological-structure
-thematic-structure


values in matricies:
-symbols (PL)
-sematic forms (lion)
-or other atribute-value matrixes (ie other functional structures)

Completeness principle
-every function designated by a PRED must be present in its f-structure

Coherence principle (converse of completeness)
-every argument must be designated by a PRED

Uniqueness principle
-every attribute has  unique value (i.e. cant have values of PL and SG)
-note: its possible to have the same values for both the OBJ and TOP attributes (a topicalized object)

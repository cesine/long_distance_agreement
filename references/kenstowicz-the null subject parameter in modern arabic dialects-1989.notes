kenstowicz shows that person agreement on the verb co-varies with the ability to have a post verbal subject. Having a postverbal subject is a requirement for having an Italian like setting for prodrop and violating the "that-trace" filter. He shows a few tests (elaborate if have time) which show that it is from postverbal position that the wh extraction happens. 

Remaining questions:
What is this postverbal position? how can subject-verb inversion take place in an embedded clause with a full C zero? the verb cant go into C zero too..

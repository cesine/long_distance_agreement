<p>The representational status and proper derivation of double object constructions have long been a subject of debate in generative grammar. Most of the controversies stem from the fact that many languages from different families display a &lsquo;dative alternation&rsquo;, although complements to verbs in these languages normally follow a relatively fixed word order. That is, an indirect object may appear either as the object of a preposition or as one of two noun phrase objects of the verb, the other being the direct object. In the latter configuration, neither has any indication of oblique case or PP status.</p>
<p>Many studies have analyzed the English double object construction and its close relatives in other languages. This review will summarize and evaluate a number of these, beginning with <link rid="b1">Fillmore&apos;s (1965</link>) classic study, continuing through some Relational Grammar studies and Government and Binding analyses such as those by <link rid="b2">Kayne (1981c</link>) and <link rid="b3">Larson (1988b</link>). Our comparative presentation and integrated conclusions crucially depend on accounts of dative and applicative alternations in several non-Indo-European languages. We terminate by covering some later analyses such as Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>) and <link rid="b5">Pesetsky (1995</link>).</p>
<p>However, our review of the massive literature on double objects doesn&apos;t pretend to be exhaustive. We regret that we could not include the most recent materials on the topic or a number of unpublished works. Nor do our short summaries really do justice to the many long and detailed studies. Rather we give a taste of each proposal, focusing as often as not on what we perceive as weaknesses rather than strengths, and try to extract certain cross-linguistic descriptive generalizations.</p>
<p>The sentences in (1) exemplify <link rid="b1">Fillmore&apos;s (1965</link>) TO-dative alternation and those of (2) his FOR-dative pattern:<link rid="fn1">

<p>It is important to observe that double object constructions encompass only patterns where neither of two NPs in a verb&apos;s complement system is a predicate nominal<i>.</i> That is, each object must stand in a different semantic relation with the verb (or be assigned different theta-roles). In traditional terms, the two NPs are direct object and indirect object (DO and IO). In contrast, the example in (3) does not contain double objects. Rather, it exemplifies secondary predication, where a predicate nominal follows and modifies the direct object. The syntax of predicate nominals differs greatly from object NPs; cf. <link rid="b6">Emonds (1985</link>: ch. 6) for a discussion of seven differences:</p>
<p>(3)&ensp;The Jets &lcub;called, considered, declared, judged, named&rcub; Officer Krupke a fink.</p>
<p>It has been often observed that head-initial SVO languages that lack a dative alternation, such as some well-studied Romance languages, nonetheless contain exact counterparts of (3). <link rid="b7">Oehrle (1976</link>) proposes that the same phrase structure rule can generate both secondary predication and double objects. However, following the demise of language-particular phrase structure rules, most analysts agree that these two kinds of double NP constructions are related neither empirically nor theoretically. Consequently, we will not further analyze secondary predication or predicate nominals.</p>
<p>We will often crucially use some well-known studies published in English for double object constructions in head-initial languages other than English: <link rid="b8">Chung (1976</link>) for Bahasa Indonesian; <link rid="b9">Kimenyi (1980</link>) for Kinyarwanda (in the Bantu family); <link rid="b10">Aissen (1983</link>) for Tzotzil (in the Mayan family); <link rid="b11">Haegeman (1985</link>) for West Flemish; <link rid="b12">Baker (1988a</link>) for many non-Indo-European languages; <link rid="b13">Baker (1988b</link>) and <link rid="b14">Alsina and Mchombo (1990</link>) for Chiche<object id="fu23" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">

<p>In the (b), or double object, examples, the verb carries what is called an &lsquo;applicative suffix&rsquo;, a term borrowed from anthropological linguistics. This suffix marks the &lsquo;promotion&rsquo; of an ordinarily oblique NP complement of an unmarked transitive verb to the direct object of that verb. Extending the terminology, it can be proposed that even verbs that are not overtly marked (English, Dutch, Mainland Scandinavian) can have null applicative inflections for indirect objects (<link rid="ss9">section 2.5</link>). Depending on whether the applicative suffix seems closer to a TO or a FOR dative, the literature usually refers to &lsquo;dative applicatives&rsquo; (4) or &lsquo;benefactive applicatives&rsquo; (5) respectively. We return briefly in <link rid="ss23">section 3.4</link> to the structural position of this affix.</p>
<p>A dative alternation often occurs in SVO systems, but it can occur in V-final systems. Korean, a thoroughgoing head-final language, has speakers who accept a double accusative construction with an applicative auxiliary verb (<link rid="b17">Choe 1986</link>). It thereby contrasts with its close syntactic cousin Japanese, also head-final, whose indirect objects must appear with a dative case marker. But with the exception of Korean and Dutch, it appears that almost all languages whose dative alternations have been scrutinized in widely available work are head-initial. Caseless double objects may thus have some affinity with head-initial systems, but we have not investigated this intriguing possibility.</p>
<p>Before turning to the more common SVO dative alternations, we summarize some results of two enlightening studies of double objects in the V-final system of Dutch, <link rid="b11">Haegeman (1985</link>) for the West Flemish dialect and Den <link rid="b18">Dikken and Mulder (1991</link>) for Standard Dutch. According to Haegeman, West Flemish treats double objects differently with two distinct verb classes, which are reminiscent of TO vs. FOR datives.<link rid="fn3">
<sup>3</sup></link> Unlike English and the many head-initial languages reviewed below, the indirect object of the TO dative can lack an overt P <i>aan</i> &lsquo;to&rsquo; only if VP-internal (as one of two objects). Such an NP can neither passivize nor topicalize without P resurfacing. Consequently, she concludes &ldquo;that the indirect object is a PP in all positions and that the prepositional head of the PP can be non-overt, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;if and only if governed by a case-assigning verb&rdquo; (1985: 285). If correct, this reinforces our suspicion that double objects involving truly bare indirect object NPs are limited to head-initial systems.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b18">Den Dikken and Mulder&apos;s (1991</link>) empirical arguments focus more on parasitic gaps and whether object scrambling in Dutch is an &lsquo;A movement&rsquo; or an &lsquo;A&prime; movement&rsquo; (read &lsquo;A&prime;&rsquo; as &lsquo;A-bar&rsquo;). Nonetheless, their structural conclusions about Dutch double objects are similar to Haegeman&apos;s. They argue that Dutch &lsquo;bare&rsquo; indirect objects (those lacking an overt preposition) have the form &lsqb;<sub>PP</sub> &lsqb;<sub>P</sub> &Oslash;&rsqb; &ndash; DP&rsqb; and are syntactically related to preverbal phrases &lsqb;<sub>PP</sub> &lsqb;<sub>P</sub><i> aan</i>&rsqb; &minus; DP&rsqb;. This &lsquo;covert prepositional dative&rsquo; structure then accounts for why bare indirect objects do not freely bind parasitic gaps. Moreover, they echo Haegeman in noting that such PP structure also accounts for an inability to passivize, in clear contrast to the bare indirect objects of verb-initial systems.<link rid="fn4">
<sup>4</sup></link>
</p>
<p>
<link rid="b11">Haegeman (1985</link>) also examines an intriguing (though inexact) West Flemish counterpart to a FOR dative (with verbs such as <i>trekken</i> &lsquo;pull&rsquo; and <i>beloven</i> &lsquo;promise&rsquo;), which seems to involve a bare NP adjunct similar to what traditional grammar often calls a &ldquo;dative of interest.&rdquo; She shows that these West Flemish NPs do clearly become nominative subjects of passive verbs, in contrast to Fillmore&apos;s observation about English FOR datives (see note 1). But she also argues that they originate outside the lowest verb phrase, that is, they are adjuncts of V&prime;. If so, they again do not constitute an &lsquo;object&rsquo; (i.e. a complement) in the sense focused on in this study.</p>
<p>As a review of existing treatments in the literature, the bulk of this chapter will necessarily concentrate on comparing those VO(O) systems which fail to distinguish their double objects either by case-marking or by an overt P. Our conclusions may or may not apply to double object constructions in head-final systems such as Dutch.</p>
<p>One descriptive generalization about such head-initial double object languages that has received little attention is that in every such language, the indirect object precedes the direct object if and only if subjects precede predicates. Typically, in well-studied SVO constructions, the indirect object must be first. But in Tzotzil, widely described as subject-final, the indirect object follows the direct (<link rid="b10">Aissen 1983</link>: 286). This generalization suggests that, at some level<i>,</i> the indirect object may have a subject-like property. And although several analyses of double objects reviewed in <link rid="ss24">section 4</link> treat indirect objects as deep subjects, it is not clear whether any of them can naturally express the apparent predicate&ndash;subject word order of Tzotzil double objects. For in order to do so, any subject-final word order would have to reflect a single factor, such as SPECIFIER position relative to a head. But concepts such as phrase-final specifiers are not discussed in these works.</p>

<p>A different sort of double object construction consists of co-occurring direct and oblique objects in languages with overt oblique morphological case(s), or &lsquo;m-case&rsquo;. <link rid="b16">Holmberg and Platzack (1995</link>) show that Icelandic has m-case. The largest class of Icelandic triadic verbs, including <i>give</i>, <i>send</i>, and <i>tell</i>, takes a direct object marked with accusative case (&lsquo;A&rsquo;) and an indirect object marked with dative (&lsquo;D&rsquo;):</p>

<p>Holmberg and Platzack carefully contrast double objects in Icelandic to double objects in Mainland Scandinavian, which lacks m-case. For example, Icelandic <i>give</i>-type verbs cannot take dative <i>to</i>-constructions, they allow DO&ndash;IO order under some circumstances, and either object may be passivized as a nominative (&lsquo;N&rsquo;). These properties are almost the opposite of those found in Mainland Scandinavian and other systems that lack m-case, such as English:</p>

<p>In our view, Holmberg and Platzack make a methodological error at the outset: they assume that Icelandic&apos;s m-case provides a key for determining how to assign abstract case in double object constructions without m-case. In particular, they assume that IOs rather than DOs must receive structural case by some extra mechanism. It seems more likely that both morphological case and the other properties of Icelandic double objects (e.g., freer word order, restrictions on benefactives, at least partial complementary distribution with overt P constructions, differences in passivization and impersonal passives) result from some deeper structural difference between Icelandic and Mainland Scandinavian. In fact, several of these properties suggest that IOs with m-case are structurally PPs.<link rid="fn5">
<sup>5</sup></link>
</p>
<p>Taking this &lsquo;fault line&rsquo; as crucial, we accordingly set empirical boundaries on this study as follows: except for subject and direct object argument NPs with so-called quirky case, we propose that object NPs with oblique case are generally PPs with null P. That is, the oblique m-cases of Icelandic, German, Latin, Slavic languages, and so on are morphological reflections of structural adpositions rather than reflexes of the dative alternation of <link rid="ss2">section 1.1</link>.</p>
<p>However, we do not claim that oblique m-case is an infallible indicator of PP status.<link rid="fn6">
<sup>6</sup></link> Obliquely case-marked object NPs that are not deep direct objects sometimes (but not typically) &lsquo;advance&rsquo; to surface direct object position and hence may not be PPs in surface structure. According to <link rid="b19">Holmberg (1991b</link>) such advancement occurs in Icelandic. In some languages an oblique case-marked NP may even be a deep direct object; for example, <link rid="b20">Faltz (1978</link>) suggests that Walbiri dative-marked NPs can be structural direct objects. We thus claim only that NP arguments of Vs are base-generated as PPs, subjects or direct objects; there are no &lsquo;bare NP&rsquo; indirect objects.</p>
<p>Reorderings and advancements of direct and oblique objects that are morphologically invariant &ndash; that is, that retain their m-cases or their overt Ps &ndash; are more likely due to scrambling than to a dative alternation. Scrambling typically (but not only) operates in languages that overtly mark NP case. For example, <link rid="b4">Den Dikken (1995c</link>: section 4.6), building on <link rid="b21">M&uuml;ller&apos;s (1992</link>) discussion of German, argues that the latter &ldquo;features no genuine Dative Shift. What appears to be Dative Shift is actually A&prime;-scrambling of a zero-headed dative PP.&rdquo;<link rid="fn7">
<sup>7</sup></link> We tentatively agree with this conclusion, although we cannot fully exclude that languages with overtly case-marked NPs could, upon investigation, reveal a non-scrambling dative alternation.</p>
<p>Den Dikken&apos;s argument is based on one line of thought in traditional grammar, to the effect that oblique cases other than genitive are alternative forms of PPs. We can state this as follows:</p>

<p>An alternative view of case assignment, espoused for example by <link rid="b22">Zaenen et al. (1985</link>, henceforth &lsquo;ZMT&rsquo;), is that &ldquo;Case can be assigned in (at least) three different ways&rdquo;: case can be semantic, idiosyncratic, or structural (&lsquo;functional&rsquo;). We might give this approach the name of &lsquo;autonomous case theory&rsquo;.<link rid="fn9">
<sup>9</sup></link> Such a theory would be less restrictive in the types of underlying structures that could be proposed for double object constructions. In particular, no underlying PP would have to be present for case assignment.</p>
<p>In this chaper, we reject any source of case other than the four structural case-assigners V, P, I, and D. Moreover we hold that any category that can assign case can do so only once. We offer six arguments for preferring this structure-dependent case theory to autonomous case theory:</p>
<p>(i)&ensp;Overt and null P parallelism. In &lsquo;four-case&rsquo; languages such as Classical Greek, German, and Icelandic, structure-dependent case (8) predicts correctly that the case of a bare second object in double object constructions &ndash; what is usually called &lsquo;dative&rsquo; &ndash; should be whichever case is ordinarily assigned by overt P.<link rid="fn10">
<sup>10</sup></link> An autonomous case theory, by simply defining the indirect object&apos;s case as &lsquo;dative&rsquo;, makes no prediction as to what case is expected with overt Ps.</p>
<p>(ii)&ensp;Oblique case complements of nouns and adjectives. Indo-European case systems suggest the following generalizations: V regularly assigns accusative case and P regularly assigns oblique case; N and A do not assign case but receive case (<link rid="b23">Stowell, 1981</link>); and when an NP does not receive case from its expected case-assigner, some P often assigns case to NP by default. These observations almost certainly hold independently even in autonomous case theory. Structure-dependent case consists simply of maintaining that these statements are exceptionless. Since bare oblique case NPs among multiple complements are exactly those lacking &lsquo;expected case-assigners&rsquo;, we hypothesize null Ps to assign them. They should occur with essentially the same distribution as other PPs.</p>
<p>Consequently, since Ns and As have PP complements but not direct objects in a wide range of languages, we expect that Ns and As can also have oblique but not accusative complements. This general asymmetric pattern, a mystery in a framework of autonomous case, is confirmed in many languages; for example, German in <link rid="b24">Van Riemsdijk (1983a</link>).</p>
<p>(iii)&ensp;Restrictions on combining oblique cases. Because the Icelandic dative can appear either as a (specially marked) direct object or as an empty-headed PP, Icelandic can have &lsquo;double datives&rsquo;, so this combination does not decide between structure-dependent and autonomous case theories. But in unstipulated constructions, structure-dependent case (8) defines accusative as the unique case assigned by V to a direct object and associates bare oblique case with PP structures. Consequently, it predicts the cross-linguistic absence of both double accusatives (outside of predicate nominal agreement) and double genitive complements. A theory of autonomous case cannot make any such prediction, as in fact its proponents admit: &ldquo;Some other gaps remain unexplained, however; for example, nothing in our account of case would prevent Icelandic from having GEN GEN or ACC ACC combinations in postverbal position&rdquo; (ZMT: 480).<link rid="fn11">
<sup>11</sup></link>
</p>
<p>(iv)&ensp;Syntactic patterning. If some syntactic restriction distinguishes between NP and PP, autonomous case theory predicts that any oblique case phrases should act as NPs. Under structure-dependent case, oblique NPs (except those arguably in unique subject and object positions) should pattern rather with PPs. Here are two examples:</p>
<p>(a)&ensp;The French relative pronoun <i>qui</i> as an object of P refers only to animate antecedents, but otherwise is indifferent to the value of this feature. When <i>qui</i> follows the dative marker <i>&agrave;</i> &lsquo;to&rsquo;, it is animate, i.e., the oblique phrase <i>&agrave; qui</i> acts like a PP (C. Piera, p.c.).</p>
<p>(b)&ensp;A small class of discourse markers such as <i>wa</i> &lsquo;topic&rsquo; and <i>mo</i> &lsquo;too&rsquo; in Japanese immediately follow maximal phrases of any type (<link rid="b25">Kuroda 1965</link>). Phrase-final nominative and accusative case markers <i>ga</i> and <i>o</i> on NP must delete in the presence of these discourse markers, but head P such as <i>e</i> &lsquo;to&rsquo; or <i>kara</i> &lsquo;from&rsquo; do not. The dative case marker <i>ni</i>, like Ps but unlike NP case-markers, appears with these discourse markers.</p>
<p>In both these examples, a structure-dependent case theory makes correct predictions, but autonomous case theory does not.</p>
<p>(v)&ensp;Quantifier floating. We are not aware of a systematic cross-linguistic study, but the literature variously indicates that quantifier floating off obliquely case-marked NPs is less acceptable. In our view, this tendency is explained because oblique NPs are embedded in PPs. Hence they do not c-command a modifying quantifier located outside the PP. See <link rid="ss21">section 3.2.6</link>.<link rid="fn12">
<sup>12</sup></link>
</p>
<p>(vi)&ensp;Undergoing NP movement. Structure-dependent case holds that an oblique case NP complement is usually a PP with an empty head. It then follows that except for direct objects with a &lsquo;quirky case&rsquo; (as in Icelandic), oblique object NPs should not be able to structurally substitute for subject NPs; they should only topicalize like a deep PP. In confirmation of our hypothesis for oblique objects, ZMT (<link rid="ss10 ss24 ss37">sections 3&ndash;5</link>) observes precisely this contrast: &ldquo;Thus the same type of tests that show that oblique NPs can be grammatical subjects in Icelandic show that the German analogues cannot be analyzed as such&rdquo; (ZMT: 478).</p>
<p>We thus take structure-dependent case as established in the rest of this study. Each V and P can assign only one case, whether or not the case is morphologically overt. V usually assigns accusative but sometimes can assign an oblique &lsquo;quirky&rsquo; morphological case. Conversely, P assigns oblique case, but in marked situations P may assign a quirky morphological accusative (German <i>f&uuml;r</i> &lsquo;for&rsquo; etc.). As we will see, this pairing of case assigners and NPs rules out a number of somewhat ad hoc analyses of dative alternations in double object constructions.</p>

<p>Much early transformational work assumed that the dative alternation resulted from a movement rule, based on the degree of regularity of its operation and the synonymy of the two alternating structures. Versions of the rule generally built the presence of a V into the structural description, since double object constructions exemplify a certain kind of verb complementation. Double object constructions appear only in those phrases which also permit prepositionless (&equals; accusative) direct objects, suggesting that the V and perhaps also the direct object have an important role in licensing a double object construction.<link rid="fn13">

<p>However, compared with similar early transformational rules such as Passive Formation, the range of conditions on English Dative Movement suggests to many that it cannot be a regular syntactic formation. The dative alternation seems to display to some extent both the features of a transformational alternation and those of a non-productive lexical alternation. Under predominant assumptions in generative thinking, it does not lend itself straightforwardly to either type of analysis. Sentences (10a&ndash;b) illustrate one example of a lexical alternation. (Lexical alternations per se are not treated in this study.)</p>

<p>As with a lexical alternation, the dative alternation does not apply across the board to all verb phrases meeting the structural description in (9). TO-datives are compatible with certain classes of &lsquo;transfer&rsquo; verbs, for example those in (11), and only some of these can undergo the alternation:</p>

<link rid="b31">Emonds (1993</link>: 227&ndash;228), in contrast, claims that such examples don&apos;t actually differ in truth values.<link rid="fn15">
<sup>15</sup></link> Rather, according to <link rid="b32">Anderson&apos;s (1971</link>) study on constant semantic properties of direct objects, truth conditions are preserved in dative alternation pairs as in (1), (2), and (14), while meanings can contrast in pairs of lexical alternations such as (10); one member of some pairs can be true while the other is false.</p>
<p>Other authors have tried to distinguish the two versions of the dative alternation on pragmatic grounds. <link rid="b33">Erteschik-Shir (1979</link>) claims that the indirect object in double object constructions tends to be definite (for her, &ldquo;non-dominant&rdquo;) and <link rid="b34">Thompson (1995</link>) that it is &lsquo;more topicworthy&rsquo;. However, such claims seem concerned at most with language use rather than syntax. For example, if a speaker wishes to contest <i>That professor teaches in a sexist way</i>, a perfectly well-formed response can be <i>But nonetheless he always teaches girls the hardest parts of his theories</i>. Here the previously unmentioned indirect object is indefinite and the direct object definite. Syntactically, dative alternations are equally well-formed with definite or indefinite objects in either position.</p>
<p>In the longer perspective, what has finally offset doubts about the synonymy of the English dative alternation and strengthened the hand of transformationalists is a number of carefully argued analyses of double object constructions in a range of non-Indo-European languages. In many such languages, a semantic indirect object alternates freely between a PP and a direct object position; when in the latter position, the verb is regularly inflected as an applicative. Most generativist analyses of applicatives have claimed that this dative alternation is productive. For <link rid="b8">Chung (1976</link>: 54&ndash;55), the only restriction in Indonesian is that &ldquo;for a handful of verbs whose indirect objects have undergone Dative, the applicative affix may be irregular or covert.&rdquo; <link rid="b13">Baker (1988b</link>) contrasts Chiche<object id="fu23" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">

</object>a&apos;s somewhat sporadically formed locative applicatives with the productivity of its benefactive applicatives. The advancement of indirect to direct object in Tzotzil, a Mayan language, also marked by a regular dative applicative verbal prefix, is not only productive but obligatory: <link rid="b10">Aissen (1983</link>) concludes that &ldquo;there are no sentences in which the indirect object has not advanced to direct object.&rdquo; Moreover she gives empirical arguments that the Tzotzil indirect object is not an &lsquo;initial 2&rsquo; of RG (&equals; a base direct object).</p>
<p>While productive relations involving applicative morphemes support a transformational account of dative alternations, they have been studied during a period when construction-specific transformations such as Dative Movement are seen as failing to capture generalizations. Thus, later proposals that the dative alternation derives from movement attempt to subsume it under Move &alpha;. These analyses, which will be reviewed in <link rid="ss24">section 4</link>, have tried to derive double object constructions from some combination of language-particular parameters and universal grammatical principles, rather than returning to a specific transformation such as (9).</p>
</subsection>
<subsection id="ss7" level="2">
<heading id="h6" level="2">2.2&ensp;Lexicalist approaches to double object structures</heading>
<p>Some linguists have argued that the English double object structure is not derived by transformation because of its uncertain productivity in that language. Rather, double object structures are directly selected by lexical entries of verbs. The two NPs are then differently interpreted in a semantic component. <link rid="b7">Oehrle&apos;s (1976</link>) dissertation is the first detailed argumentation that dative pairs result from a lexical alternation. Verbs like <i>give</i> and <i>send</i> subcategorize for two sets of complements, NP PP and NP NP. The two sets are related through a &lsquo;lexical redundancy rule&rsquo;, a less narrowly defined mechanism than movement rules. He proposes that double objects have the &lsquo;flat&rsquo; structure in (15), where both NPs are sisters to the verb:</p>
<p>(15)<object id="fu1" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">

<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu1.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu1_source"/>

</object>
</p>
<p>Oehrle additionally argues that certain movement restrictions on dative NPs, which we review in <link rid="ss11">section 3.1</link>, arise from a general constraint on the accessibility of &lsquo;inner&rsquo; NPs (those closest to the verb).</p>
<p>The theory of Lexical Functional Grammar (<link rid="b35">Kaplan and Bresnan 1982</link>) proposes a similar &lsquo;surface&rsquo; analysis for double object verbs. Two distinct sets of grammatical functions are assigned to the unified predicate argument structure of Agent, Theme, and Goal:</p>

</p>
<p>These functions then map directly onto surface strings where OBJ2 is Oehrle&apos;s &lsquo;inner object&rsquo; and the direct object is labelled OBJ. Thus, any systematic pairings of meanings in the double object construction are expressed directly only in predicate argument structures. As for any syntactic correspondences, the LFG system also &ldquo;captures the systematic connection between NP&ndash;NP and NP-to-NP constructions by means of a lexical redundancy rule&rdquo; (<link rid="b35">Kaplan and Bresnan 1982</link>: 180).</p>
<p>Although <link rid="b28">Green&apos;s (1974</link>) framework includes transformational relations, she bases her analysis of indirect objects rather on the semantic properties of relevant verbs. She groups verbs that license Dative Movement into different semantic classes, and relates these classes to different underlying structures, associating several verbs with the base structure (15) rather than a structure including a PP. For example, <i>pass</i> and <i>take</i> are in the &lsquo;<i>bring</i>&rsquo; category, <i>feed</i> is in the &lsquo;<i>give</i>&rsquo; category, <i>buy</i> and <i>save</i> in the &lsquo;<i>selection</i>&rsquo; group, and so on. She concludes that &lsquo;Dative Movement&rsquo; should actually be divided into a series of interrelated processes that relate double object constructions and NP&ndash;PP sequences in either direction &ndash; from NP PP to NP NP or from NP NP to NP PP &ndash; according to those combinations of semantic features available for the verb in question. This approach is actually reminiscent of <link rid="b36">Harris&apos;s (1957</link>) notion of transformational relations between sets of surface paradigms.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b29">Pinker (1989</link>) formulates a theory of lexicosemantic representation that attempts to make the semantic characteristics of &lsquo;dativizable&rsquo; verbs more precise. His main concern is how children are able to learn the dative alternation without access to negative evidence. That is, the child must learn without being told which verbs are unavailable for the double object construction. For example, how does the learner realize that <i>give</i> is acceptable in this context, but <i>donate</i> is (usually) not, although the two verbs have very similar meanings? (For a full discussion of this issue, see <link rid="b29">Pinker 1989</link>: ch. 1.)</p>
<p>Pinker proposes a &lsquo;Grammatically Relevant Subsystem&rsquo; hypothesis, arguing that &ldquo;there is a set of semantic elements and relations that is much smaller than the set of cognitively available and culturally salient distinctions, and verb meanings are organized around them&rdquo; (<link rid="b29">Pinker 1989</link>: 166). Linguistic processes, including lexical alternations, are sensitive only to members of this set. He then develops a set of relevant verbal features and uses linking rules to map certain groupings of features onto certain syntactic structures. These features are detailed enough to distinguish between dativizable verbs and similar verbs that do not display the dative alternation. (See <link rid="b29">Pinker 1989</link>: ch. 5.) Although Pinker&apos;s analysis is lexicalist in the sense that he assumes without argument that &lsquo;Dative Movement&rsquo; is a lexical alternation, nothing in his theory precludes applying it to a transformational theory of datives. In fact, it might serve to weaken one of the main arguments against Dative Movement, that its application is not predictable.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b30">Jackendoff (1990a</link>) is another theorist who believes, like Oehrle, that a lack of full productivity in the dative alternation supports a purely lexical account of double objects. He reserves transformations for more transparently regular alternations such as passive. He elaborates on some of Green&apos;s ideas for verb classes, claiming that the semantic facts of double objects and their verbs militate against a transformational analysis, at least for English. For Jackendoff, generalizations about theta-roles do not explain the difference between verbs that allow double objects and those that do not. Unlike Pinker, he finds no plausible contrast between the roles assigned by <i>give</i> and <i>donate</i>, which both appear to assign &lsquo;beneficiary&rsquo; and &lsquo;goal&rsquo; roles to their complements. He feels rather that the inherent meanings of verbs determine whether there is a dative alternation.</p>
<p>For example, verbs of creation or preparation such as <i>sing</i> or <i>bake</i> allow double objects, while benefactive NPs with other verbs such as <i>copy</i> or <i>eat</i> occur only in <i>for</i>-phrases:</p>

</p>
<p>But Jackendoff&apos;s analysis of this paradigm actually undermines his argument that dative alternations are lexical. He suggests that creation/preparation verbs take a <i>for</i>-phrase complement, whereas <i>for</i>-phrases with verbs like <i>eat</i> and <i>copy</i> are adjuncts. But if so, Move &alpha; cannot &lsquo;lower&rsquo; an adjunct, presumably base-generated outside V<sup>1</sup>, into direct object position. A transformational account therefore seems to explain precisely the contrast Jackendoff brings to bear against it.<link rid="fn16">

</p>
<p>Along similar lines, <link rid="b30">Jackendoff (1990a</link>: 449) favors a lexicalist account for a generalization of <link rid="b29">Pinker (1989</link>), whereby motion verbs that &ldquo;imply influence of the Agent continuing throughout the Theme&apos;s trajectory&rdquo; do not appear with double objects:</p>

<p>An adequate analysis should probably relate this distinction to whether the P indicates an actual spatial trajectory, as in (18a), or whether it simply introduces a third NP argument, as in (18b). We return to this distinction in <link rid="ss9">section 2.5</link>.</p>
<p>Lexical explanations for the dative alternation among Chomskyan theorists received a theory-internal boost in 1981. Chomsky&apos;s <i>Lectures on Government and Binding</i> does not argue against a movement derivation for double objects. However, his Projection Principle, a central tenet of Government-Binding theory, requires that the argument structure and thematic roles of complement phrases remain constant throughout a derivation. As it is used in that work, this principle rules out the possibility of a surface structure configuration like (19a) (where the complement phrase consists of two NPs) being transformationally derived from a deep structure (19b) (where the complement phrase consists of an NP and a PP):</p>

</p>
<p>Thus, we understand why <link rid="b37">Czepluch (1982</link>: 1) introduces a contemporaneous discussion of the dative alternation with the comment: &ldquo;Nowadays it is widely held that the alternation between the prepositional IO and the prepositionless IO represents a lexical rather than a transformational relationship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Generativists (e.g., <link rid="b37">Czepluch 1982</link>: note 5) could nonetheless see that assuming Oehrle&apos;s (20) as the deep structure for double objects creates many problems for Government-Binding theory:</p>

<p>We enumerate five such problems with flat double object structures here:</p>
<p>(i) A flat deep structure for double objects precludes any straightforward syntactic account of the synonymous pairs in the dative alternation, including the pairings in the fairly transparent productive applicative systems of the Bantu languages, Indonesian, etc.<link rid="fn17">
<sup>17</sup></link>
</p>
<p>(ii) A simple and hence optimal case theory states that case assigners (such as V and P) assign exactly one grammatical case to a single, adjacent NP (cf. <link rid="b5">Pesetsky 1995</link>: 124). This is our Structure-Dependent Case theory in (8). In a flat structure, the assignment of case to the second NP of the double object construction in (20) becomes problematic. <link rid="b38">Chomsky (1981</link>: ch. 3) assumes that the V in this situation assigns an additional &lsquo;inherent Case&rsquo; to one of the objects and the usual structural case to the other. Thus one or the other type of case assignment applies over an adjacent NP only in this exceptional instance. As explained in a cross-linguistic study of passives (<link rid="b39">&Aring;farli 1992</link>: <link rid="ss11">section 3.1</link>), such double assignment of case undercuts attempts at coherently characterizing &lsquo;case-absorption&rsquo; in passives.</p>
<p>(iii) Work on double object applicative constructions in non-Indo-European languages, first in the framework of Relational Grammar (<link rid="b8">Chung 1976</link>; <link rid="b9">Kimenyi 1980</link>; <link rid="b10">Aissen 1983</link>) and later in Government-Binding under the impetus of <link rid="b40">Marantz (1984</link>) and <link rid="b41 b12">Baker (1985a, 1988a</link>), revealed many syntactic properties which demonstrate that prepositionless indirect objects function cross-linguistically as surface direct objects, while the deep direct objects they occur with do not. An additional paradigm using particles (<link rid="b42">Emonds 1972a</link>) supports the same conclusion for English. This body of work taken together (see <link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>) argues that the indirect object must be &lsquo;promoted&rsquo; (using Relational Grammar terms) from a deep status of an &lsquo;initial 3&rsquo; (a deep oblique complement) to a &lsquo;final 2&rsquo; (a surface direct object) in the course of a derivation. Flat deep structures obscure this &lsquo;promotion&rsquo;.</p>
<p>(iv) Whether or not one embeds a flat deep structure (20) into the Government-Binding framework, any explanation of the syntactic restrictions on double object constructions (discussed in <link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>) based on some kind of structural &lsquo;inaccessibility&rsquo; of an inner NP is too powerful. It incorrectly predicts that indirect object NPs cannot be passivized; see note 1. <link rid="b43 b44">Whitney (1982, 1983</link>) and <link rid="b37">Czepluch (1982</link>) discuss in more detail the inadequacy of the structure (20) as a basis for explaining the grammatical relations and syntactic properties of double object constructions.</p>
<p>(v) The important and influential squib of <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>) shows that several considerations based on binding of anaphors, weak crossover, quantifier-variable pairings, superiority, and negative polarity &ndash; the very cornerstones of Government-Binding theory &ndash; require that the indirect object in a double object construction, for example in (1b), (2b), and (14a, c), asymmetrically c-command the direct object to its right. (Cf. also <link rid="b3">Larson 1988b</link>; <link rid="b5">Pesetsky 1995</link>: 125&ndash;126.) As this influential piece is transparently written, easily accessible, and mercifully brief, we will not summarize it further, but simply accept their preliminary conclusion as a basis for further discussion: &ldquo;The problem now is to determine how it is that the first NP in a double-object VP asymmetrically c-commands the second NP, and this requires discussion of the phrase structure of these VPs&rdquo; (<link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik 1986</link>: 350).<link rid="fn18">
<sup>18</sup></link>
</p>
<p>A final logical weakness of lexicalist accounts of datives is the nature of their argument that, since non-alternating double objects (double object sentences without a <i>to-</i> or <i>for</i>-phrase paraphrase) occur anyway, a rule of dative movement is redundant. This reasoning is curious, since prosaic sentences resembling passive transforms (<i>John was killed by the riverside</i>) are never taken to argue for the redundancy of the passive transformation.<link rid="fn19">
<sup>19</sup></link>
</p>
<p>Perhaps what is lacking from the lexicalist perspective is the ability to imagine a plausible derivation for these non-alternating sentences. Suppose that a double object verb such as <i>cost</i> or <i>deny</i> is lexically specified for two NP complements, as in <i>This watch cost Mary fifty dollars</i>. An obvious consequence of an optimal case theory such as (8) is that a V cannot have two object NP sisters, so that the most economical base structure that satisfies such a lexical specification is (21):</p>
<p>(21)&ensp;This watch cost NP &lsqb;<sub>PP</sub> &lsqb;<sub>P</sub> &Oslash;&rsqb; NP&rsqb;</p>
<p>
<link rid="b26">Herriman (1995</link>: 204), citing several traditional grammarians, observes that the second complements of many non-alternating double objects are indeed akin to &ldquo;NP adverbials.&rdquo; They are thus possibly PPs whose P is idiomatically zeroed either optionally (<i>envy</i>, <i>forgive</i>) or obligatorily (<i>fine</i>, <i>spare</i>). Other verbs with non-alternating double objects may fall under one of the analyses in <link rid="ss9">section 2.5</link>.</p>
<p>We conclude that non-alternating double objects, as in (13), do not bear on the issue of whether English or any other language exhibits transformational raising of indirect to direct objects.</p>

<p>The tension resulting from the requirements of Government-Binding theory<link rid="fn20">
<sup>20</sup></link> and the need for a cross-linguistically convincing analysis for double objects stimulated a &ldquo;datives industry&rdquo; throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Some linguists first attempted to reconcile a theory of base-generated double objects with Chomsky&apos;s Case theory by building in covert syntactic structure. In particular, <link rid="b37">Czepluch (1982</link>) and <link rid="b46">Kayne (1984b</link>) analyze the indirect object NP as a &lsquo;covert&rsquo; PP with a P that remains empty throughout the derivation, as in (22). In both analyses, the direct object is case-marked by the verb, although not under the adjacency to V<sup>0</sup> required by <link rid="b23">Stowell (1981</link>):</p>
<p>(22)<object id="fu4" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu4.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu4_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>
<link rid="b37">Czepluch (1982</link>) proposes that ordering of the PP before the NP in (22) is determined by the requirements of case assignment and Chomsky&apos;s Empty Category Principle, which forces the dummy P to be properly governed. The empty P attaches to the verb through Reanalysis, allowing the verb to indirectly transmit case to the indirect object NP.</p>
<p>For <link rid="b46">Kayne (1984b</link>: 195&ndash;196), &ldquo;an empty preposition cannot be the source of Case,&rdquo; but can &ldquo;transmit to its object an objective case received by percolation only if prepositions in that language normally assign objective case. Then objective case transmission by P<sub>e</sub> is available in English, but not in French.&rdquo; Kayne&apos;s proposal is then that P assigns case differently in the two languages, although neither language has overt case morphology outside the pronoun system.<link rid="fn21">
<sup>21</sup></link> This treatment of the dative also &ldquo;leads one to conclude that the &lsqb;dative passive&rsqb; is an instance of preposition stranding, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;except that the stranded preposition is empty&rdquo; (1984b: 196).</p>
<p>While we share with Zhang some uncertainty over exactly what Kayne and also <link rid="b3">Larson (1988b</link>) actually imply in this regard, we agree that &ldquo;under one possible interpretation, Kayne&apos;s and Larson&apos;s theory makes the following claim: Languages that do not permit P-stranding also do not permit Dative Shift&rdquo; (<link rid="b15">Zhang 1990</link>). <link rid="b47">Hoekstra (1995</link>: 122) makes this explicit: &ldquo;the English pattern of indirect object passivization is limited to languages allowing preposition stranding.&rdquo; Zhang&apos;s squib shows that Chinese contradicts any such claim, as do Indonesian and other non-Indo-European languages with dative applicatives. As observed in Van <link rid="b48">Riemsdijk (1978a</link>), P-stranding is rare and probably limited to a subset of Germanic languages; hence it cannot be a precondition of a dative alternation.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b23">Stowell (1981</link>) analyzes the dative alternation in terms of movement, but upon closer inspection it is more a lexicalist than a &lsquo;Move &alpha;&rsquo; solution. In his view, indirect object NPs incorporate into the verb (V<sup>0</sup>) by means of a &lsquo;word formation rule&rsquo;, one which creates words of unlimited complexity, such as the bold sequence in <i>The girl <b>sent the man who had won huge sums of money at Monte Carlo</b> flowers</i>. The complex verb assigns case to the direct object NP and, rather problematically, the prepositionless indirect object also receives or &lsquo;absorbs&rsquo; case from the adjacent verb. An indirect object is thus realized either as a lexical NP or an empty NP co-indexed with the incorporated NP, as in (23):</p>
<p>(23)<object id="fu5" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu5.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu5_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>If a lexical indirect object NP is realized outside V<sup>0</sup>, the P <i>to</i> is inserted adjacent to it as its case-assigner.</p>
<p>Stowell&apos;s solution to the non-productivity issue incorporates aspects of earlier lexicalist semantic proposals. He notes that obligatory double object verbs such as <i>cost</i> indicate a kind of possession of the direct object by the indirect. Presumably, the indirect object has a Possessor theta-role in these cases, but not the role of Goal. On the other hand, some indirect object NPs receive the role of Goal but not that of Possessor, as exemplified in <i>David sent a package to England</i>. Stowell proposes to attribute the dative alternation to an indirect object having the double role of Goal/Possessor (or Goal/Beneficiary in the case of FOR-datives). When a V allows a dual interpretation, the indirect object NP may incorporate into the V or not. If V assigns only the Possessor role, NP must incorporate; if V assigns only the role of Goal, incorporation is disallowed.</p>
<p>For Stowell, indirect objects receive theta-roles differently according to their structural position after Dative Movement. That is, if Possessor is something like a &lsquo;principal&rsquo; theta-role, the NP must be inside V<sup>0</sup>, while a Goal as a principal theta-role is incompatible with such an NP. However one formalizes this relation between word formation and theta-roles, it is the output of his Dative Movement that is playing the classical role of deep structure. That is, (23) represents the level relevant for theta-role interpretation, which is in turn input to a transformational derivation. But any rule that applies prior to deep structure in a Government-Binding framework is not a transformation but a lexical relation. Finally, then, Stowell&apos;s is a lexicalist solution.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b49">Hellan (1991b</link>) proposes the following covert structure to solve the case-marking problem (ii) of <link rid="ss7">section 2.3</link>. He adopts a right-branching base structure, as shown in (24):</p>
<p>(24)<object id="fu6" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu6.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu6_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>The verb marks the topmost NP-DO for case, in accordance with <link rid="b23">Stowell&apos;s (1981</link>) adjacency requirement. Case-marking then percolates down to the lower NP-DO. The indirect object is inherently case-marked by virtue of its position in the structure, similar to <link rid="b38">Chomsky&apos;s (1981</link>) proposal for how an English possessive NP receives its case. Like the &lsquo;small clause&rsquo; analyses we review later, one can say that Hellan&apos;s (24) straightforwardly expresses Stowell&apos;s idea that the indirect object &lsquo;possesses&rsquo; the direct object in the double object construction. On the other hand, the notion of case being assigned without a case assigner contravenes the original concept of abstract case, which pairs case assigners with case-marked NPs. Moreover, as will be seen in <link rid="ss35">section 4.4</link>, the existence of a single constituent uniting both double objects is problematic.</p>
<p>The above four Government-Binding variants of base-generated double objects (Czepluch, Hellan, <link rid="b46">Kayne 1984b</link>, and Stowell) do not provide an appropriate underlying structure for the asymmetrical c-command required by <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>), or for explaining the derived direct object properties (iii) and (iv) of <link rid="ss7">section 2.3</link>. In addition, beyond one or two considerations that each author brings up in support of his idea, their modifications away from an optimal version of case theory, where case assigners assign only one kind of case to a single sister NP along the lines of Structure-Dependent Case (8), don&apos;t simplify or explain other areas of grammar.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that, taken together, the arguments (i)&ndash;(v) against flat structures enumerated in <link rid="ss7">section 2.3</link> settle the first debate. Lexicalist analyses, especially in the Government-Binding framework, have not solved the double case problem (ii). They do not address the compelling cross-linguistic regularities of applicative constructions (iii), summarized below in <link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>. And they fail to provide the badly needed asymmetric c-command of the deep direct object by the bare indirect object (v). We thus take the position that a double object construction results from transformationally promoting to direct object a deep indirect object of a P, whose untransformed English spell-out is a <i>to</i> or <i>for</i> phrase. The still debated nature of this transformational process will occupy us in <link rid="ss24">section 4</link>.</p>

<heading id="h9" level="2">2.5&ensp;Solving non-productivity</heading>
<p>The transformationalist accounts of productive non-Indo-European dative and benefactive applicative constructions have emboldened advocates of dative movement, but a more satisfactory account of its non-productivity in English is still needed. Some variant of <link rid="b5">Pesetsky&apos;s (1995</link>: section 5.1.3) proposal to extend a type of applicative suffix to English (and perhaps other Germanic languages) may solve this problem.</p>
<p>Suppose that English verbs in either TO-dative or FOR-dative alternations occur with a null affix of derivational morphology as in either (25a) or (25b). We leave aside discussion of its features and its role in licensing double objects until <link rid="ss23">section 3.4</link>. For the moment, we take this derivational formation to be &lsquo;right-hand headed&rsquo; in the sense of <link rid="b50">Williams (1981b</link>), as in either (25a) or (25b), and we assume that this null affix shares a feature PATH with the directional P that it appears to replace:</p>

<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu7.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu7_source"/>

</object>
</p>
<p>Under this analysis, English now conforms to a cross-linguistic generalization, which Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>: ch. 5) refers to as the &ldquo;systematic homophony of so-called applicative and causative affixes.&rdquo; He fully illustrates this phenomenon, based on parallel verb affixations in Indonesian, Nahuatl (<link rid="b51">Tuggy 1987</link>), and Sanuma (<link rid="b52">Borgman 1989</link>). Using Pesetsky&apos;s zero morpheme, we can say that English applicatives and English causatives for many base adjectives are also homophonous: they share a (non-productive) zero affix.<link rid="fn22">
<sup>22</sup></link>
</p>
<p>On one level, this proposal just displaces the problem of non-productivity into the lexicon, but this is where both morpheme lists and null morphs are known to play a role (<link rid="b5">Pesetsky 1995</link>: 128&ndash;129). For example, it allows for natural expression of a generalization about word formation that must haunt even the most devoted partisans of lexical unpredictability: namely, general classes of &lsquo;short&rsquo; verbs in English enter into dative alternations productively.</p>
<p>In this regard, <link rid="b53">Fraser&apos;s (1974</link>: 13&ndash;15) discussion of which verbs combine with postverbal particles is pertinent, for the same class of English verbs productively exhibits TO-dative and FOR-dative alternations. &ldquo;Surprisingly enough, it is the phonological shape of a verb that determines to a large extent whether or not it can combine with a particle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the majority of verbs occurring with particles are monosyllabic and the remainder are made up primarily of bi-syllabic words which are initially stressed.&rdquo; The English lexicon must thus contain the following restriction on &lsquo;null applicatives&rsquo;:</p>

</p>
<p>Once (26) is properly expressed as derivational morphology, relatively few double object verbs have to be listed separately as appearing either optionally or obligatorily with the null applicative affix. For the TO-dative alternation, the following verbs with some non-initial stress are listed in <link rid="b26">Herriman (1995</link>: 61, 104): <i>accord</i>, <i>administer</i>, <i>advance</i>, <i>afford</i>, <i>allocate</i>, <i>allot</i>, <i>allow</i>, <i>apportion</i>, <i>assign</i>, <i>assure</i>, <i>award</i>, <i>begrudge</i>, <i>bequeath</i>, <i>concede</i>, <i>deliver</i>, <i>deny</i>, <i>extend</i>, <i>forbid</i>, <i>permit</i>, <i>prohibit</i>, <i>recommend</i>, <i>refund</i>, <i>refuse</i>, <i>reimburse</i>, <i>remit</i>, <i>repay</i>, <i>return</i>, <i>telegraph</i>, <i>telephone</i>, and <i>vouchsafe</i>. For the FOR-dative she lists (1995: 124, 146) <i>design</i>, <i>embroider</i>, <i>ensure</i>, <i>furnish</i>, <i>guarantee</i>, <i>occasion</i>, <i>prepare</i>, <i>prescribe</i>, <i>procure</i>, <i>provide</i>, <i>purchase</i>, <i>reserve</i>, and <i>secure</i>. However, most of these &lsquo;exceptions&rsquo; can be analyzed as containing a prefix and an initially stressed stem.<link rid="fn24">
<sup>24</sup></link>
</p>
<p>In standard American speech, verbs that carry secondary or non-initial stress are usually incompatible with a dative alternation. However, (26) may be relaxed to a style (27) in which any singly stressed English verb can take double objects. This accounts for examples like the following, although they are still excluded in the restricted style: <i>We delivered Mary the package</i>; <i>Bill embroidered her a blouse</i>:</p>

<p>This change of style drastically shortens Herriman&apos;s list of exceptional double object verbs. In the other direction, some of the non-alternating double object verbs discussed in <link rid="ss7">section 2.3</link> (e.g., <i>ask</i>, <i>bet</i>, <i>charge</i>, <i>cost</i>, <i>deny</i>) may be lexically listed as obligatorily requiring the null applicative affix; little would seem to turn on this.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b54">Gropen et al. (1989</link>: 243&ndash;245) list some verb classes that don&apos;t occur with double NPs even though they satisfy (26). Two types are &ldquo;manner of speaking&rdquo; verbs (<i>scream</i>, <i>whisper</i>, <i>yell</i>) and verbs of continuously caused motion (<i>drag</i>, <i>move</i>, <i>push</i>), exemplified in (18) in <link rid="ss6">section 2.2</link>. Indirect objects of such verbs are always expressed in <i>to</i>-phrases. In these cases, following <link rid="b3">Larson (1988b</link>: <link rid="ss37">section 5</link>), it may well be that the P&apos;s independent theta-role assigning content causes it to be present throughout the derivation. In the terms of <link rid="b31">Emonds (1993</link>), reviewed here in <link rid="ss36">section 4.5</link>, such Ps are lexicalized in deep structure, which blocks their object NP from advancing to direct object. <link rid="b5">Pesetsky (1995</link>) and Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>) propose a similar account in terms of a lexical P that assigns a theta-role characterized by &ldquo;continuous imparting of force.&rdquo; As a reviewer notes, perhaps the term &lsquo;indirect object&rsquo; is simply not appropriate for objects of these contentful Ps.</p>

<p>For English, this restriction on <i>wh</i>-movement is first noted in <link rid="b1">Fillmore (1965</link>). <link rid="b55">Ross (1986</link>) observes that indirect objects without P cannot undergo rightward Complex NP Shift (30d) either. Further examples of (29) are presented and discussed in <link rid="b7">Oehrle (1976</link>), <link rid="b56">Ziv and Sheintuch (1979</link>), <link rid="b57">Hornstein and Weinberg (1981</link>), <link rid="b43 b44">Whitney (1982, 1983</link>), <link rid="b37">Czepluch (1982</link>), <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>), <link rid="b12">Baker (1988a</link>: section 5.4), and <link rid="b49">Hellan (1991b</link>).</p>
<p>As <link rid="b43 b58">Whitney (1982, 1984</link>) observes for English, the restriction (29) generalizes to all Government and Binding &lsquo;A&prime;-movements&rsquo;, that is, movements to non-argument positions, whether to the left or right, as in (30d).<link rid="fn26">
<sup>26</sup></link> This bi-directionality in itself excludes any account of (29) that depends on a left&ndash;right asymmetry, such as many theories of parsing and some syntactic theories. These movement restrictions apply even though the dative NP behaves like a direct object in other ways (see <link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>) and is in a position (next to the verb) in which a base-generated direct object would be movable.</p>

<p>Before reviewing how authors have treated restriction (29) theoretically, it is important to appreciate that this kind of syntactic property strongly suggests that a promoted Goal phrase, even though it has the position and many other properties of a direct object, is not simply that. Even without a fully satisfactory account of the cross-linguistic paradigm (29), a promotion analysis at least distinguishes between (1&ndash;2) and (28b). Simply considering double object constructions to be base-generated provides no reason at all to expect different behavior under A&prime;-movement.</p>

<p>
<link rid="b7">Oehrle&apos;s (1976</link>) base analysis includes the statement that inner NPs, that is, those followed by a direct object, are inaccessible to movement rules, but this basically only rephrases the problem posed by restriction (29). Moreover, <link rid="b12">Baker (1988a</link>: 295) points out that explanations based on the inaccessibility of an inner NP (as defined by the simultaneous presence of an &lsquo;outer NP&rsquo;) encounter a further difficulty. In Chiche<object id="fu23" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">

</object>a and Chamorro, morphologically identifiable applicatives with promoted oblique NPs can be formed with certain classes of intransitive verbs. Extraction of the applied object in these cases is just as bad as extraction of the inner object of a transitive verb. Accounts of (29) that depend on the presence of two NPs, rather than on the derivational status of the promoted NP, are thus inadequate.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b23">Stowell&apos;s (1981</link>) solution for the Restriction on A&prime;-extraction (29) is somewhat more attractive. Recall that in his analysis (23), a bare English indirect object (of whatever length) is incorporated under the V by a &lsquo;word formation rule&rsquo;. It then follows that the inner NP cannot be further moved, as syntactic rules never apply to parts of words. <link rid="b3">Larson (1988a</link>) also invokes some type of inaccessibility restriction based on a verb forming a deep constituent with an indirect object.<link rid="fn28">
<sup>28</sup></link> Both Stowell and Larson circumvent the problem of the bare dative NPs&rsquo; seeming ability to move (only) to A-positions by claiming that &lsquo;dative passives&rsquo; (34) involve movement from an outer, non-promoted position directly to the subject position. Since the deep indirect objects then receive case after passivization, there is no need for an oblique <i>to</i> or <i>for</i> with a trace t<sub>k</sub>:</p>

<p>Once English dative passives are not derived directly from double object constructions, however, an important generalization is lost. Early generative analyses observed that English verbs which do not permit prepositionless double objects prohibit dative passives as well:</p>

<p>That is, dative passives appear to derive, in English at least, from double object constructions. <link rid="b47">Hoekstra (1995</link>: <link rid="ss10">section 3</link>) provides two further arguments against passivizing indirect objects in their base position. Along the same lines, Romance languages lack dative passives because they lack bare double objects. Thus, the following descriptive generalization encompasses both English and Romance:</p>

</p>
<p>The Stowell and Larson accounts of dative passives contravene (36) and thus fail to predict data such as (35) naturally.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b37">Czepluch (1982</link>) takes a different approach to the restriction in (29). As seen in <link rid="ss8">section 2.4</link>, he analyzes bare datives in terms of a base-generated PP headed by an empty P. He rules out extraction of the bare dative NP through a constraint on movement out of empty-headed phrases, which would leave a presumably unacceptable &lsquo;layered trace&rsquo; under a PP. In order to nonetheless allow dative passives, Czepluch must extend case theory so that these layered traces are unacceptable only under the conditions of A&prime;-movement. That is, a sentence like *<i>Who did John give the book?</i> is ruled out because the trace of <i>who</i> cannot be either directly or indirectly case-marked.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b4">Den Dikken (1995c</link>: <link rid="ss26">section 4.2</link>) provides a somewhat similar account of (29) that also involves the structure of a PP. Summarizing relevant data from a range of authors, he concludes that only &ldquo;short&rdquo; (clause-bound) <i>wh</i>-movement of promoted IOs can be grammatical, as in (30a), and this only in some languages, such as Dutch, Norwegian, and certain dialects of English. For these systems with grammatical &ldquo;short&rdquo; overt <i>wh</i>-movement of indirect objects, i.e., which seems to contravene (29), Den Dikken argues that an entire PP headed by an empty dative-assigning P is fronted.<link rid="fn29">
<sup>29</sup></link> In contrast, he claims that many A&prime;-extractions, including at least those in (30b&ndash;c), involve Empty Operator Movement or more generally simple movement of an NP, and these are always excluded (1995: 188). Our formulation of (29) does not require P to be overt, and hence countenances Den Dikken&apos;s analysis or others which permit a fronting of an empty-headed PP.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b12">Baker (1988a</link>: 299) proposes a different refinement of Czepluch&apos;s approach, which he calls the Non-Oblique Trace Filter. This filter blocks any trace of an A&prime;-operator lacking oblique case if its non-verbal governor incorporates into a higher verb. By stipulating the presence of an operator in the filter, he automatically exempts passive traces from it while still blocking A&prime;-movements, or in other words the restriction stated as (29). It is doubtful whether this ad hoc device works empirically, since it also appears to wrongly rule out A&prime;-movement of a passivized bare indirect object, which is cross-linguistically permitted (<link rid="b14">Alsina and Mchombo 1990</link>: <link rid="ss4">section 2</link>).</p>
<p>
<link rid="b49">Hellan (1991b</link>) illustrates (29) for Mainland Scandinavian, arguing that the trace of an A&prime;-movement of a bare indirect object is ill-formed, rather than movement itself. In his structure (24) for double objects, the verb governs just the direct object; the bare indirect object is licensed and receives a theta-role only by virtue of its structural position (akin to a possessive NP). Moreover, he claims that such lexical NPs do not need to receive an abstract case, whereas traces of <i>wh</i>-movement uniformly do require case. Hence, those NPs licensed by virtue of their structural position, and not by a lexical licenser, are precisely those which cannot undergo A&prime;-movement (29). A virtue of this proposal is that it can account for why possessive NPs in English, for example, are not available for A&prime;-movement either. However, it must be observed that extracting possessive NPs (the Left Branch Constraint of <link rid="b55">Ross 1986</link>) is significantly less acceptable than violating (29).</p>
<p>
<link rid="b43 b44">Whitney (1982, 1983</link>) proposes an account of (29) that does not require extending case theory or special restrictions on movement of the inner NP. Like Czepluch and Baker, she assumes that indirect objects are generated under a PP. They then move to their surface position next to the verb, leaving a trace in the usual way:</p>
<p>(37)<object id="fu8" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu8.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu8_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>All further movements to an A&prime;-position, including Complex NP Shift and other A&prime;-movements (<link rid="b44 b58">Whitney 1983, 1984</link>), leave a trace that serves as a variable in LF. Further movement of indirect objects is then blocked by <link rid="b59">Chomsky&apos;s (1982</link>: 31) principle that a variable &ldquo;must be A-free in the domain of the operator that binds it.&rdquo; The variable in the position of IO<sub>k</sub> is under the first branching node V&prime; over the original indirect object trace, therefore not A-free.<link rid="fn30">
<sup>30</sup></link>
</p>
<p>This analysis correctly predicts that <i>wh</i>-movement, Complex NP Shift, and other movements of bare indirect objects to A&prime;-positions are ruled out, while movements to an A-position, like passive, are acceptable. It also distinguishes base-generated NPs next to the verb, which are extractable, from indirect objects that have been promoted to direct object position, which are not.</p>
<p>Whatever the ultimate fate of these competing proposals for explaining the restriction (29), this robust cross-linguistic paradigm itself strongly suggests that bare indirect objects are not generated in the base as direct objects but rather move to their surface position. The restriction on their further movement, which base-generated direct objects are not subject to, can be satisfactorily accounted for only if their transformational history is distinct from that of direct objects.</p>

Similarly in (38c), the lower bold NP may take either wide scope (the topics are fixed) or narrow scope (the topics vary with the girls).</p>
<p>But as <link rid="b60 b62">Aoun and Li (1989, 1993</link>b) point out, a prepositionless indirect object as in (39) seems to tolerate only wide scope. That is, (39) does not typically mean that every girl had the same topics. Rather, the girl is fixed first (wide scope) and then the topics:</p>
<p>(39)&ensp;He assigned <i>every girl in the class </i><b>two new topics</b>.</p>
<p>What is of interest in this regard is that wide-scope readings of the higher italic NPs are also strongly favoured in structures derived by subject raising (40a), passive (40b), and, as pointed out by a reviewer, locative inversion (40c):</p>

<p>The property illustrated in (39)&ndash;(40) is called &lsquo;Scope Freezing&rsquo;. A plausible initial description of what is at stake involves movements into argument positions, which in a range of cases are apparently subject to (41):</p>

<p>We are often somewhat sceptical of the relevant acceptability judgments, and consequently find it difficult to use Scope Freezing to evaluate the merits of the rather complex structures and derivations proposed by various authors. What seems clearer and actually more to the point for our purposes is the fact that this phenomenon pretty clearly groups together promoted prepositionless indirect objects with other &lsquo;moved NPs&rsquo; such as those raised to SPEC(IP) in (40). Thus, while it is easy to interpret the base-generated example <i>He talked with every girl in the class about two new topics</i> with wide scope on topics (there are only two), a parallel interpretation of (39) seems at best forced and unnatural.</p>
<p>From this perspective, whatever its ultimate structural analysis, it is plausible to conclude that Scope Freezing (41) constitutes a second diagnostic for the derived rather than base-generated status of bare indirect object NPs.</p>

<heading id="h15" level="2">3.2&ensp;Direct object properties of promoted indirect objects (Relational Grammar 3 &rarr; 2)</heading>
<p>
<link rid="ss12">Section 3.1.1</link> has highlighted an important syntactic property (29) of prepositionless indirect objects that &lsquo;betrays their origins&rsquo;: these objects differ from direct objects in resisting A&prime;-movements. Deep direct objects with a Goal role are not subject to this restriction: <i>What did you spray with paint? Who did you approach on the street?</i> Provided promoted indirect objects leave a trace of some sort, an account of (29) in terms of a general condition on variable binding is in principle available.</p>
<p>A second restriction on promoted indirect objects is &lsquo;Scope Freezing&rsquo;, i.e., their inability to house (English) quantifiers with narrow scope, as discussed in <link rid="ss14">section 3.1.3</link>. Finally, a third restriction, observed in <link rid="b12">Baker (1988a</link>: 278&ndash;279, <link rid="b13">1988b</link>), is that the head indirect object noun in benefactive applicatives cannot &lsquo;incorporate&rsquo; into a governing verb (in contrast to a deep direct object noun). We thus have three independent reasons to believe that bare indirect objects are not simply structural deep objects with Goal theta-roles, but are somehow transformationally derived.</p>
<p>With respect to most other properties, however, dative shifted NPs behave like direct objects, whether or not a language has an overt applicative affix. In Relational Grammar (RG) studies such as <link rid="b63">Perlmutter and Postal (1983b</link>), this change is described as &lsquo;3 to 2 advancement&rsquo;, where 2 indicates a direct object. As a result of advancement, a deep or initial indirect object behaves like a direct object with respect to a whole battery of syntactic and morphological diagnostics for direct objects. A side effect of this advancement is that a deep or initial direct object NP is demoted to what RG calls &lsquo;ch&ocirc;meur&rsquo; status. That is, a ch&ocirc;meur NP fails a number of these same diagnostic tests for surface direct object status.</p>
<p>In many languages with productive dative alternations, an overt &lsquo;applicative&rsquo; verbal affix accompanies the advancement to direct object. <link rid="b64">Marantz (1982</link>) proposes that this situation is typical: when verbs have supplementary overt morphology corresponding to an oblique argument NP, that NP and not the usual direct object behaves like a surface direct object. <link rid="b12">Baker (1988a</link>: section 5.3.1) refers to this remarkable cross-linguistic pattern as Marantz&apos;s Generalization. However, as we see below, advancement is not invariably accompanied by an overt applicative suffix.</p>

Some form of the benefactive suffix .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is typically added to the verb&rdquo; (1976: 41). She emphasizes that P is omitted if and only if &ldquo;the IO is moved between the DO and the verb,&rdquo; exactly as specified in the early transformational rule (9) for English:</p>

<p>Chung then goes on to provide extensive and convincing arguments that an indirect object promoted by Dative behaves as a direct object in Indonesian. &ldquo;The IO can, for instance, be passivized.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It can be replaced by the true reflexive, <i>diri</i> &lsquo;self&rsquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It can undergo Object Preposing, if the subject of the sentence is a pronoun &lsqb;the normal condition on this rule&rsqb;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the original IO is subject to the major &lsqb;deletion&rsqb; strategy, with <i>jang</i>, for Relative Clause Formation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In contrast, &lsqb;for any of these diagnostics&rsqb; the underlying DO no longer behaves like a direct object after Dative has applied&rdquo; (1976: 58&ndash;60).</p>

<link rid="b9">Kimenyi&apos;s (1980</link>) analysis of Kinyarwanda advancement is another detailed RG study of double objects. We have used the succinct summary of this work in <link rid="b65">Poser (1982</link>).</p>
<p>Kimenyi finds evidence for several transformational alternations of complement phrases in the language, and the various rules promoting oblique objects introduce applicative inflections on the verb. One of these rules promotes indirect objects to direct object status. His study enumerates an impressive number of corresponding operations distinguishing Kinyarwanda direct from oblique objects, which he refers to under the rubrics of Passive, Stativization, Object&ndash;Subject Reversal, Pronoun Incorporation, Reflexivization, Clefting, Pseudo-Clefting, Exclusive Insertion, and Existential Insertion. Using the same logic as Chung&apos;s study, he then shows that Kinyarwanda prepositionless indirect objects invariably act like direct objects with respect to these operations.</p>

<heading id="h18" level="3">3.2.3&ensp;Tzotzil</heading>
<p>
<link rid="b10">Aissen&apos;s (1983</link>) RG study of indirect objects in Tzotzil shows that arguments for advancement to direct object can be constructed even in the absence of a dative alternation. She specifically couches her analysis in terms of derivations: &ldquo;While my conception of sentence structure follows that of relational grammar in its essentials, I assume that these levels of relational structure do constitute a derivation, roughly in the spirit of transformational grammar&rdquo; (1983: 274).</p>
<p>A special characteristic of Tzotzil is that its lexicon lacks P morphemes whereby indirect objects can surface in PPs. &ldquo;Two facts about Tzotzil obscure the existence of Indirect Object Advancement. First is the fact that &lsqb;42&rsqb; is the only way to say &lsquo;I sold pigs to Sun&rsquo;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Second, &#x010D;<i>itom</i> &lsquo;pig&rsquo; in &lsqb;42&rsqb; is, it will be claimed, the initial direct object, but not final direct object, this relation being held by <i>li Sune</i>. <i>Citom</i> is a final direct object ch&ocirc;meur&rdquo; (1983: 272&ndash;273):</p>

<p>She observes that in the double object construction &ldquo;the verb agrees in person with the indirect object and not the direct object&rdquo; (1983: 281), as exemplified by the obligatory first person object agreement in (43b). Similarly, the Tzotzil verb agrees in animate number with promoted indirect objects but not demoted direct objects. She concludes, &ldquo;There are three kinds of evidence that the initial indirect object is the final subject of the passive sentence: evidence from person agreement, number agreement, and word order&rdquo; (1983: 282&ndash;283).</p>
<p>A lexicalist response to Aissen might be to view Tzotzil Goal phrases as simple variants of direct objects. We reproduce two of her arguments against this position: (i) The verbal suffix <i>-be</i> in (42&ndash;43), which we gloss as applicative, may not occur with simple transitives. (ii) A different verbal suffixation with <i>-van</i>, which indicates a discourse-specified human direct object, &ldquo;is quite regular and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;there appear to be no lexical exceptions&rdquo; (1983: 292). However, this <i>-van</i> apparently marks only <i>deep</i> direct objects, since it cannot replace a subject of an intransitive complement to a causative (44b). The fact that (fully productive) <i>-van</i> is equally ungrammatical with an indirect object signaled by <i>-be</i> (44c) confirms that the latter cannot be a deep structure direct object either:</p>

<p>The pattern is considered to have quite different implications in analyses that group double objects into small clauses, such as <link rid="b66">Kayne (1984c</link>) and <link rid="b4">Den Dikken (1995c</link>: ch. 3).

<p>A second test distinguishing English derived direct objects from ch&ocirc;meur NPs involves shifted quantifiers. <link rid="b8">Chung (1976</link>: 81&ndash;82) observes that in Indonesian, non-adjacent &lsquo;floated&rsquo; quantifiers are fully acceptable as modifiers of subjects and direct objects, but not as modifiers of PPs or ch&ocirc;meurs. The same (admittedly rather weak) contrast holds in English, where the test concerns not quantifiers at the end of the clause as in Indonesian, but rather quantifiers shifted just to the right of the NP they modify. These NPs with floating modifiers can be either direct objects (49a) or promoted indirect objects (49b), but they cannot be PPs, as seen in (49c&ndash;d):</p>

<p>As observed in <link rid="ss7">section 2.3</link>, <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>) discuss six different paradigms, widely thought to be best accounted for in terms of <link rid="b38">Chomsky&apos;s (1981</link>: ch. 3) Binding Theory and c-command at LF. These paradigms require that the English promoted indirect object in a double object construction asymmetrically c-command the demoted or ch&ocirc;meur NP. The constructions include antecedent/bound anaphor pairings (e.g., <i>send the two managers each other&apos;s foreman</i> vs. *<i>send each other&apos;s manager the two foremen</i>), quantifier/bound singular pronoun pairing (e.g., <i>every man</i>, <i>his</i>), weak crossover paradigms, superiority restrictions on <i>wh</i>-extraction, and negative polarity pairings. It suffices to summarize here by observing that they are widely taken to establish the conclusion (52):</p>

<p>Thus, there has also emerged a consensus concerning whether double object constructions are transformationally derived. Many authors now agree that they are, and the indirect or applied object surfaces in a direct object position asymmetrically higher than the deep direct object, which is somehow &lsquo;demoted&rsquo;.

<heading id="h23" level="2">3.4&ensp;The position of the applicative affix</heading>
<p>Provided we retain the right-hand headedness of English (and most other) morphology, there are only two possible structures (cf. <link rid="ss9">section 2.5</link>) for a null applicative affix on English double object verbs: a null grammatical head V, as proposed in <link rid="b67">Marantz (1993</link>), or an incorporated P:</p>
<p>(25)<formula format="inline">
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu7.jpg" type="jpg"/>
</formula>
</p>
<p>We have seen throughout <link rid="ss1 ss10">sections 1 and 3</link> that overt applicative affixes are generally suffixes across languages. Unsurprisingly then, <link rid="b12">Baker&apos;s (1988a</link>&ndash;b), which derives them by head movement of P into V (cf. <link rid="ss25">section 4.1</link>), represents the incorporated applicative P as a suffix. However, in a clear majority of well-motivated head movements that give rise to single words, such as noun incorporation and V-raising, a moved head becomes a prefix. This discrepancy in morpheme order within a V then suggests the correctness of (25a) for representing applicatives.</p>
<p>Indeed, the morphemes for the benefactive applicatives in head-final Korean VPs (<link rid="b17">Choe 1986</link>) and the dative applicatives in complement-final Chinese VPs (<link rid="b68">Huang 1991</link>) can both alternatively appear as independent V glossed as &lsquo;give&rsquo; in those languages. Moreover, the Korean applicative verb <i>cwu</i>- takes the full range of the morphology associated with that language&apos;s verbs. Thus, we do not hesitate to hypothesize that applicative suffixes, both overt and covert, are uniformly of category V, in accord with the expectations of <link rid="b69">Lieber&apos;s (1980</link>) and <link rid="b50">Williams&apos;s (1981b</link>) word-internal Right Hand Head Rules.</p>
<p>Assigning applicative suffixes to the category V additionally explains why languages fail to have parallel constructions in other types of phrasal projections; the complex V structure of (25a) but not the P-incorporation of (25b) accounts for the cross-linguistic impossibility of applicative nouns or applicative adjectives, for example.<link rid="fn33">

<subsection id="ss26" level="2">
<heading id="h25" level="2">4.1&ensp;Double objects result from incorporation of a null Case-marker</heading>
<p>Most Relational Grammar analyses have consistently argued that an indirect object (&lsquo;an initial 3&rsquo;) in applicative constructions simply replaces the direct object (&lsquo;becomes a final 2&rsquo;). From this it correctly follows that promoted indirect objects act as direct objects with respect to later processes that depend on the final grammatical status of an NP, exactly as required by the considerations of <link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>. Under this view, the (optional) fate of a deep or initial direct object in RG is to be demoted into the &lsquo;ch&ocirc;meur&rsquo; (unemployed) status of <link rid="b63">Perlmutter and Postal (1983b</link>), though still remaining vaguely associated with the main verb. In phrase structural terms, the demoted deep object NP remains somewhere in the deep VP.</p>
<p>However, both promotion and demotion within VP contravene <link rid="b38">Chomsky&apos;s (1981</link>) Projection Principle, at least as it has been widely understood. Thus, the Relational Grammar conception of &lsquo;3 to 2 advancement&rsquo;, translated into Government-Binding terms, violates the usual formulation of the Projection Principle twice.</p>
<p>One way to ensure that a promoted indirect object both acts as a direct object for several syntactic processes and at the same time asymmetrically c-commands an RG ch&ocirc;meur is to claim that the required surface relation of the double objects is simply their deep relation. That is, no NP movement or promotion occurs. This can be implemented by postulating that some empty (surface) P introduces the thematic direct object, as in (53):</p>

<p>This is <link rid="b5">Pesetsky&apos;s (1995</link>: 125) proposal: &ldquo;The second object of a double object construction .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;is &lsqb;an NP&rsqb; introduced by a null Case-assigning element G.&rdquo; This empty G selects an NP with a &lsquo;Theme&rsquo; semantic role (i.e., a direct object) and &ldquo;must move from its base position &lsqb;in (53)&rsqb; and affix .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to the governing verb&rdquo; (1995: 127). Pesetsky goes on to discuss various possibilities for fixing the category of G, and tentatively concludes that the best candidate is P.<link rid="fn34">
<sup>34</sup></link>
</p>
<p>Pesetsky&apos;s hypothesis provides a simple theory of structure-dependent case-assignment (one case-assigner for each NP; <link rid="ss3">section 1.2</link>) as well as an explanation for the non-productivity of the English double object construction (<link rid="ss9">section 2.5</link>). Nonetheless, it reduces to a latter-day version of lexicalism, since the incorporation of P plays no structural role in either the syntax or the interpretation of the two NPs. Its disadvantages are consequently due to the fact that the bare indirect object has no transformationally derived character: (i) <link rid="b32">Anderson&apos;s (1971</link>) general semantic properties of direct objects, which promoted indirect objects lack, become stipulated aspects of the item G (<link rid="b5">Pesetsky 1995</link>: 179&ndash;180); (ii) the base structure (53) cannot explain the Restriction on A&prime;-extraction (29); (iii) <link rid="b10">Aissen&apos;s (1983</link>) arguments against deep representations like (53) for Tzotzil go unanswered (<link rid="ss18">section 3.2.3</link>); (iv) there is no explanation for why promoted indirect object nouns exhibit &lsquo;Scope Freezing&rsquo; (<link rid="ss14">section 3.1.3</link>) or cannot undergo the further step of incorporation in a language with that option (<link rid="b13">Baker 1988b</link>).</p>
<p>In addition, overt applicative realizations of incorporated Ps are generally homophonous with Goal rather than Theme prepositions (e.g., Chinese <i>gei</i> &lsquo;to&rsquo;; <link rid="b15">Zhang 1990</link>); this tendency creates awkwardness for the structure (53).</p>
<p>Pesetsky&apos;s proposal is structurally similar to, but derivationally distinct from, an earlier, extremely influential proposal of <link rid="b12 b13">Baker&apos;s (1988a, 1988b</link>). Baker accounts for Marantz&apos;s Generalization by a variant of (53) in which a null surface P introduces the first (indirect) rather than the second (direct) object. Unlike Kayne&apos;s earlier proposal for an empty P which remains in situ, discussed above in <link rid="ss8">section 2.4</link>, Baker claims that a deep P transformationally incorporates into V, leaving a trace and surfacing as overt dative and benefactive applicative morphemes, as in the Chiche<object id="fu23" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">

</p>
<p>According to Baker, an empty P cannot govern or assign case to its object, so this NP must receive case from some other source. He achieves this and explains many other derived direct object properties of RG&apos;s promoted indirect objects by utilizing his quite convincing and general Government Transparency Corollary (<link rid="b12">Baker 1988a</link>: 64). According to this proposal, if a head Y (here P) adjoins to a higher head Z (here V), then a phrase otherwise governed by Y becomes governed by Z. Since the complex V (V &plus; P) in (54) then governs the stranded NP, the latter is assigned accusative and treated as a direct object. Incorporation and Government Transparency thus together account for the fact that deep oblique NPs can behave as surface direct objects. To further ground this system empirically, <link rid="b12">Baker (1988a</link>: ch. 5) surveys in detail several properties of applicative systems rather schematically reviewed in <link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link> above.<link rid="fn35">
<sup>35</sup></link>
</p>
<p>Baker&apos;s and Pesetsky&apos;s analyses of double object constructions have in common that they respect the standard interpretation of <link rid="b38">Chomsky&apos;s (1981</link>) Projection Principle: neither analysis modifies the position of any complement NP in the course of a derivation, and consequently no single VP contains multiple links in a single argument chain. A further merit of Baker&apos;s framework is that transformational P-incorporation (a subcase of head movement) accounts for the difference between the deep and surface status of the bare indirect object; this &lsquo;inner NP&rsquo; is governed by P in deep structure and hence lacks properties of deep direct objects, but by V in surface structure, whereby it acquires direct object properties through Government Transparency.</p>
<p>Baker&apos;s &lsquo;transformationalist incorporation&rsquo; (54) is supported by several intricate properties of the applicative systems he examines, and it escapes the criticisms we levelled against Pesetsky&apos;s &lsquo;lexicalist incorporation&rsquo; analysis (53). Nonetheless, (54) appears to have two serious weaknesses. First, the asymmetric c-command required for the paradigms of <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>) is exactly the opposite of that in (54), as observed in <link rid="b31">Emonds (1993</link>), <link rid="b67">Marantz (1993</link>), and <link rid="b5">Pesetsky (1995</link>). Since the deep direct object asymmetrically c-commands the indirect object at the end of the derivation, the binding properties holding between double objects should be the opposite of what holds for English double objects, or at least the second &lsquo;outer&rsquo; NP should act like it c-commands the first.</p>
<p>Second, Baker is left without a general device by which the deep or &lsquo;demoted&rsquo; direct objects in (54) can acquire case, or at least pass the Case Filter. Consequently, he develops two alternatives in his section 5.3.4, one in terms of a highly stipulative extension of case theory and a second in terms of a rather abstract &lsquo;LF incorporation&rsquo; of the thematic direct object (thus exempting it from the Case Filter in his system). The revised case theory not only subscribes to a non-explanatory notion of autonomous case (cf. <link rid="ss3">section 1.2</link>), but also extends the inherent vs. structural case dichotomy in several directions.<link rid="fn36">
<sup>36</sup></link> <link rid="b5">Pesetsky&apos;s (1995</link>) variant on Baker&apos;s incorporation is in fact principally motivated by his explicitly less baroque view of case assignment.</p>
<p>Baker&apos;s second alternative for satisfying the Case Filter abandons assigning case to the second NP in a double object construction. Rather, he proposes &lsquo;N-incorporation in LF&rsquo; for the ch&ocirc;meur of the dative alternation which would otherwise violate case theory. This sidestepping of the Case Filter seems to be pretty much an untestable hypothesis, though he tries to turn the obligatory incorporation of second objects in Southern Tiwa applicatives to his advantage.<link rid="fn37">
<sup>37</sup></link> It is hard not to conclude that such purely abstract use of incorporation has no effect other than rendering the incorporated constituents essentially exempt from any claims of grammatical theory.</p>
<p>Finally, although Baker&apos;s structure (54) provides a means for formulating a &lsquo;Non-Oblique Trace Filter&rsquo; to explain the Restriction on A&prime;-extraction (29), the actual formulation and workings of his filter seem ad hoc (cf. <link rid="ss13">section 3.1.2</link>).</p>
</subsection>
<subsection id="ss27" level="2">
<heading id="h26" level="2">4.2&ensp;Double objects are two arguments in small clauses</heading>
<p>Several Government and Binding authors have proposed that double object structures in Germanic languages are in fact grouped into single constituents. The indirect object and the direct object are then respectively taken to be the surface subject (or &lsquo;Specifier&rsquo;) and the object (or &lsquo;Complement&rsquo;) inside this constituent. Disputes concern the exact categorical nature of this putative phrase and its head, which we can here call neutrally &lsquo;XP&rsquo;, as well as the issue of whether the surface position of the IO in (55) is base-generated or derived by movement:</p>
<p>(55)&ensp;<object id="fu12" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">

</p>
<p>Provided that the &lsquo;subject&rsquo; IO is higher than the &lsquo;complement&rsquo; DO in the surface form of XP, all these analyses can account for the consensus on superiority (52), i.e., the paradigms in <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>), whether or not they predate that article. If an analysis utilizes the XP structure so as to move the indirect object to its surface position in (55), presumably into SPEC(XP), the analysis also has a good chance of capturing the ways the IO doesn&apos;t act like a deep direct object (51), as well as the further Restriction on A&prime;-movement (29).</p>
<p>However, in all these analyses, the internal structures attributed to each author&apos;s categorial choice for the XP remain fairly problematic. It should be kept in mind that overt &lsquo;internal NP subjects&rsquo; of categories other than IP and DP are actually never attested in English in diagnostic positions such as a focus in clefts or pseudo-clefts. These &lsquo;object phrase&rsquo; analyses moreover typically require that V govern across the XP boundary into the SPEC position, not only for assigning case to the IO but also for the several other surface object properties brought out especially in Relational Grammar studies (cf. <link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>). Few of these analyses make any attempt to either broadly justify or precisely define this kind of governance, exceptions being <link rid="b2">Kayne (1981c</link>) and Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>).</p>
<p>Especially when XP in a structure like (55) is not some projection of V, it is customary to refer to it as a &lsquo;small clause&rsquo; (i.e., a clause-like structure lacking many &ndash; or nearly all &ndash; clausal properties). The choices for XP can be IP (formerly S) or PP, reviewed in this section, or NP/DP, reviewed in <link rid="ss35">section 4.4</link>. The choice of VP for XP (&lsquo;Larsonian shells&rsquo;) is reviewed in <link rid="ss30">section 4.3</link>.</p>

<heading id="h27" level="3">4.2.1&ensp;Some doubts about small clauses</heading>
<p>
<link rid="b2">Kayne (1981c</link>) proposes that trees must be binary branching, which leads him to conclude that double objects form a constituent rather than each being a sister to V. As the binary branching hypothesis has been so influential, practically blinding the field in our opinion to any approach inconsistent with it, it is worth looking into the justifications given for it.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b2">Kayne&apos;s (1981c</link>) initial justification for binary branching is a purely formal exercise. A type of tree relation between antecedents and traces alluringly named an &lsquo;unambiguous path&rsquo; is shown to be compatible only with binary branching trees.<link rid="fn38">
<sup>38</sup></link> However, as the article&apos;s first section indicates, there is nothing &lsquo;unambiguous&rsquo; in binary trees about the actual location of an antecedent; in order to find an anaphor&apos;s antecedent, the direction &lsquo;up or down&rsquo; in the tree must be specified independently at each dominating node. That is, specifying unambiguous paths to an antecedent is simply a formal equivalent to specifying c-command over strings of variable length.</p>
<p>Subsequently, <link rid="b66">Kayne (1984c</link>) presents theoretical and empirical arguments to motivate binary branching and hence small clause structures for English double objects. We first treat in turn four considerations that seem to have impressed subsequent analysts: (i) an argument based on learnability, (ii) the relation of binary branching to Kayne&apos;s theory of &lsquo;connectedness&rsquo;, (iii) the way Kayne insulates small clause theory from disconfirmation, and (iv) argumentation based on coordinations. We delay until the next subsection his proposal for English paradigms with particles, (47&ndash;48) above, which bear more directly on double objects.<link rid="fn39">
<sup>39</sup></link>
</p>
<p>(i)&ensp;Learnability. <link rid="b66">Kayne (1984c</link>: ix) remarks that binary branching &ldquo;constitutes a step towards a solution to the learnability problem for phrase structure (How does the language learner know what tree representation, of all those available in theory, to associate with a given sentence?).&rdquo; This remark has impressed later researchers, being echoed for example in Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>: 27). But in fact binary branching does not reduce the set of grammars, since learned parts of grammars, probably the lexical entries of functional categories, actually contain no information about branching. Rather, as Kayne&apos;s cited rhetorical question indicates, binary branching can facilitate not acquisition but <i>processing</i>. It can (only) help associate <i>given sentences</i> with certain trees rather than others.</p>
<p>But to our knowledge, procedures that have been implemented for processing models invariably use the argument-taking devices of heads in a central way, whether these be thought of as argument structures, theta-grids, lexical conceptual structures, event structures, or subcategorization frames. In these procedures, an indispensable step in either producing or comprehending a sentence of any complexity is always (56):</p>

</object>
</p>
<p>If no structural economy were built into using argument information, arguments could be located anywhere &ndash; not even near the head in question.</p>
<p>Now binary branching suggests no way to eliminate or supplant (56). But given (56), there is no processing reason for associating arguments with a head by any means other than sisterhood; sisterhood is required whenever it is possible. Of course, research has revealed many grammatical reasons for positing a non-sister relation between heads and their subjects, so-called &lsquo;external arguments&rsquo;, independently of any concerns here with double objects. However, has it found comparable reasons for any non-sister relation for &lsquo;internal arguments&rsquo;, which should be similarly justified? Our evaluations below of many proposals for such non-sister complement structures suggest rather that binary branching results in convoluted and inadequate analyses.</p>
<p>Consequently, not only is binary branching unrelated to language acquisition, in models of sentence processing it at best supplements economy of representation (56). We thus cannot agree with <link rid="b4">Den Dikken (1995c</link>: 28), who claims that small clauses &ldquo;are available at no cost whatsoever.&rdquo; We rather feel that their additional structure must be empirically justified by improved characterizations of paradigms involving double complements.<link rid="fn40">
<sup>40</sup></link>
</p>
<p>(ii)&ensp;Connectedness. In an impressive series of detailed analyses of extraction and movement phenomena, <link rid="b70 b2 b71">Kayne (1981a, 1981c, 1983</link>) develops a theory of &ldquo;connectedness&rdquo; in trees which is designed to account for a number of paradigms involving extractions, parasitic gaps, multiple questions, etc. These papers do not discuss binary branching (or double objects), but it is true enough that researchers such as Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>: 28) often conceptualize or explicate this theory in terms of binary branching trees.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the connectedness results can be recast without binary branching, although to demonstrate this in detail would require a paper in itself. Informally, Kayne&apos;s final statement of connectedness (1983) requires the deepest variables bound by operators to be terminal right branches; nothing mentions a left branch, i.e., a subject of a small clause. An alternative formulation that <link rid="b2">Kayne (1981c</link>: note 36) himself cites is the analysis of <link rid="b72">Koster (1978b</link>: ch. 2); we are more familiar with a slightly different version in <link rid="b73">Koster (1978a</link>), called there the Nesting Hypothesis.<link rid="fn41">
<sup>41</sup></link> We would reformulate the latter in terms of prohibiting material to the right of the most embedded bound category it applies to; such an approach to the material treated under the rubric of connectedness does not refer to branching at all. Thus, binary branching is not an intrinsic ingredient of connectedness or more generally of successful theories of movement and extraction.</p>
<p>(iii)&ensp;Insulation. Binary branching depends very much on small clause (&lsquo;SC&rsquo;) analyses for many double complement structures. Yet the following assumptions largely &lsquo;insulate&rsquo; small clause theory from disconfirmation: &ldquo;Taking small clauses to be maximal projections .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;, &lsqb;they are&rsqb; transparent to government only when the governor and the maximal projection are sisters&rdquo; (<link rid="b66">Kayne 1984c</link>: x) and &ldquo;N cannot govern across a boundary&rdquo; (1981c: <link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>). Thus, if a small clause in its base position is a sister to V, it acts as though it isn&apos;t there (due to transparency). If it is anywhere else (moved or a sister to N or base-generated in some ungoverned position), it also acts as if it isn&apos;t there, because its subjects (at least those Kayne discusses) are in need of case, which they cannot get in any of these positions. Consequently, the general way to test for presence of a constituent in generative grammar, namely movement (<link rid="b55">Ross 1986</link>), is rendered inoperative. Even strong supporters of small clause structures agree with this observation (<link rid="b4">Den Dikken 1995c</link>: 47, 61). So finally, a small clause ends up acting syntactically as if it isn&apos;t there; it plays no role in movement or in limiting movement.<link rid="fn42">
<sup>42</sup></link>
</p>
<p>On this point, a referee correctly observes that normal clauses (IPs) also often act &ldquo;as if they aren&apos;t there&rdquo;; they don&apos;t move away from their introductory C and, when non-finite, are not barriers to case-marking from the outside. But these observations simply underscore the tenuous status of IP itself (as a binary branching daughter of a projection of C). This weakness doesn&apos;t argue for small clauses, but rather undercuts even <link rid="b74">Bresnan&apos;s (1970</link>) binary division between C and IP. Nonetheless, she supported her division by noting that parentheticals can divide C and IP. <i>The Board will declare &lcub;that/whether&rcub;, during the past year, the company has been profitable</i>. Such parentheticals are unacceptable with small clauses: <sup><i>??</i>
</sup><i>The Board will declare, during the past year, the company profitable</i>. This difference implies that there are no positive diagnostics for small clause constituency.</p>
<p>Of course, the question remains: is insulation from disconfirmation, achieved for SCs by Kayne&apos;s two cited theoretical stipulations, a good thing or a bad one? Several researchers seem to feel that it provides a kind of license for ubiquitous small clause structures. But insulation from disconfirmation cannot in itself constitute a reason to reject alternatives using ternary branching for representing double objects, which after all accords with a straightforward interpretation of economy of representation (56).</p>
<p>(iv)&ensp;Coordination. Small clauses might be motivated by paradigms based on coordinations (or deletions) rather than movement. For example, authors sometimes cite coordinations as in (57) as support for small clause constituents:</p>
<p>(57)&ensp;John &lsqb;<sub>VP</sub> turned &lsqb;<sub>SC</sub> &lsqb;<sub>SC</sub> the heat up&rsqb; and &lsqb;<sub>SC</sub> the air conditioning down&rsqb;&rsqb;&rsqb;.</p>
<p>But these sequences are arguably reductions of coordinate VP or IP with an empty second V as in (58), parallel to similar coordinate sequences as in (59):</p>
<p>(58)&ensp;John &lsqb;<sub>VP</sub> &lsqb;<sub>VP</sub> &lsqb;<sub>V</sub> turned&rsqb; &lsqb;<sub>NP</sub> the heat&rsqb; up&rsqb; and &lsqb;<sub>VP</sub> &lsqb;<sub>V</sub> &Oslash;&rsqb; &lsqb;<sub>NP</sub> the air conditioning&rsqb; down&rsqb;&rsqb;.</p>

<p>These latter can&apos;t be small clauses since the combinations <i>his wife on Saturday, Mary mornings</i>, etc. are not predications.</p>
<p>The possibility of replacing <i>and</i> in both (58) and (59) with <i>but</i>, as in (60a), is also telling. This is a possible clausal coordination pattern for root predications, as in the structures in (58&ndash;59). However, a coordination of clausal complements as in (60b), whether they be SCs or of any other type, would require a <i>not</i> after <i>but</i>:</p>

<heading id="h28" level="3">4.2.2&ensp;Sentence-based small clauses</heading>
<p>Whatever one&apos;s theoretical predispositions with respect to small clauses, analyses using them must still be evaluated on their empirical merits. So let us now turn to the argumentation in <link rid="b2 b66">Kayne (1981c, 1984c</link>) for grouping English indirect and direct objects together as small clauses.</p>
<p>In <link rid="b2">Kayne&apos;s (1981c</link>: <link rid="ss6 ss7">sections 2.2&ndash;2.3</link>) first proposal, the small clause XP over English IOs and DOs is an S. It neither is endocentric nor places the IO higher than the DO. In a second proposal (<link rid="b46">Kayne 1984b</link>) (inferred from his note 5, &ldquo;it now seems preferable to follow Stowell,&rdquo; and from his page xi), XP is apparently NP; the bold sequence in <i>send </i><b><i>&lsqb;</i><sub><i>NP</i>
</sub><i> &lsqb;</i><sub><i>PP</i>
</sub><i> Mary&rsqb; &lsqb;</i><sub><i>NP</i>
</sub><i> Bill&apos;s book&rsqb;&rsqb;</i>
</b> presumably has the curious form &lsqb;<sub>NP</sub>&lsqb;<sub>PP</sub>&lsqb;<sub>P</sub> &Oslash;&rsqb; NP&rsqb; &minus; NP&rsqb;.</p>
<p>
<link rid="b2">Kayne (1981c</link>) makes a detailed argument for these SCs based on their being impossible in English nominalizations, crucially using his postulate that &ldquo;N cannot govern across a boundary.&rdquo; Consequently, a prepositionless indirect object cannot properly receive case inside a nominalization because the small clause boundary insulates it from government. This argument could extend to other small clause analyses of double objects, as their proponents are doubtless aware. But in competing transformational accounts, any promotion of indirect objects in an NP domain will necessarily place them in a PP so that they can receive case. But then they will not c-command their base position, i.e., their traces will be improperly bound. Such considerations equally well explain the absence of double object constructions in NPs. So Kayne&apos;s influential nominalization argument in favor of double object small clauses is not definitive.<link rid="fn44">
<sup>44</sup></link>
</p>
<p>As another argument for analyzing double objects as small clauses, <link rid="b71">Kayne (1983</link>c) uses the ordering restriction illustrated in (61), according to which English intransitive &lsqb;<sub>PP</sub> P&rsqb; must precede &lsqb;<sub>PP</sub> P &minus; XP&rsqb; (<link rid="b42">Emonds 1972a</link>):</p>

<p>Kayne excludes (61b) by means of &lsquo;recursive small clauses&rsquo; as in <i>make &lsqb;<sub>YP</sub> &lsqb;<sub>XP</sub> &lsqb;<sub>NP</sub> John&rsqb; &lsqb;<sub>X&rsquo;</sub> a liar&rsqb;&rsqb; &lsqb;<sub>Y</sub> out&rsqb;&rsqb;</i>. Since <i><i>make</i>
</i> is not a sister of XP, the latter&apos;s subject is ungoverned, hence not assigned case, hence ungrammatical. However, his discussion provides no indication of how this small clause structure contributes to meaning. Thus, the sharply different SCs for the synonymous pair (62) would apparently have no effect on meaning:</p>

</p>
<p>Additionally, the fact that (62b) is good for many speakers, including the authors, disconfirms Kayne&apos;s account of (61b), since his proposal rules out (62b) on exactly the same grounds as (61b). Moreover, the very fact that these small clause structures seem scattered about with no specification of their distribution is highly suspect.</p>
<p>Finally, consider the secondary predication <i>bring John his food cold</i>. While recursive small clause structures (AP inside YP) might accommodate <i>bring &lsqb;<sub>YP</sub> &lsqb;John&rsqb; &lsqb;<sub>Y</sub> &Oslash;&rsqb; &lsqb;<sub>AP</sub> &lsqb;his food&rsqb; &lsqb;<sub>A</sub> cold&rsqb;&rsqb;&rsqb;</i>, an identical bracketing could also tolerate <i>*make John a liar out</i>. A solution might consist of imposing an ordering restriction on intransitive P as heads of SCs, thereby bringing us back to the starting point of <link rid="b42">Emonds (1972a</link>). Consequently, the restriction evidenced in (61b) ends up providing no evidence of small clause structure.</p>
<p>There thus seem to be no real arguments for double object small clauses in <link rid="b66">Kayne (1984c</link>), nor do the theoretical acquisition or connectedness considerations often advanced in their favor have any force. The structures themselves have significant drawbacks, as mentioned in the discussions of the SCs in (61) and (62). To these can be added the oddity of their internal structure, as seen in (62). The only consideration that remains in their favor is <link rid="b2">Kayne&apos;s (1981c</link>) account of why they do not occur in English nominalizations, an account that we feel could be challenged along the lines indicated above.</p>

<heading id="h29" level="3">4.2.3&ensp;PP-based small clauses</heading>
<p>
<link rid="b4">Den Dikken (1995c</link>: ch. 3) provides a more carefully designed and defended SC analysis of English double objects as complex PPs, with special attention to their properties when they occur with particles (&lsquo;Prt&rsquo;), as in <i>John sent Bob off a package</i>.<link rid="fn45">
<sup>45</sup></link> By applying <link rid="b12">Baker&apos;s (1988a</link>) Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (&lsquo;UTAH&rsquo;), he defends his cross-linguistic proposals with argumentation based on Dutch and Chinese double object constructions as well. While the author explicitly bases his SC framework on the dubious theoretical motivations for small clauses (learnability, connectedness, and binary branching), his extensive argumentation does not entirely rest on them, and hence must be independently evaluated.</p>
<p>Aspects of Den Dikken&apos;s analysis derive from his assumptions that SCs (i) &ldquo;are available at no cost whatsoever,&rdquo; (ii) &ldquo;are the sole incarnation of subject predicate relationships,&rdquo; and hence (iii) &ldquo;all share the semantic aspect of property ascription&rdquo;<link rid="fn46">
<sup>46</sup></link> (1995c: 24&ndash;25, 28). His resulting SC structures, which he considers costless, are in our view somewhat arbitrary, as per our <link rid="ss27">section 4.2.1</link>. That is, they don&apos;t satisfy movement diagnostics for PPs, and moreover the mechanisms for how predicates select them are not specified.</p>
<p>The center of his analysis is that English postverbal particles are &lsquo;unaccusative&rsquo; P heads of SCs. Deep structure PPs for double objects with particles therefore contain two small clauses, as in (63):<link rid="fn47">
<sup>47</sup></link>
</p>
<p>(63)<object id="fu13" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">

</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>
<link rid="b4">Den Dikken (1995c</link>: sections 3.7&ndash;3.8) further claims that a third empty headed verbal small clause SC&prime; above (63) provides additional surface housing for a sequence NP &plus; Prt, for theoretical reasons related to PPs but extraneous to the double object NPs.</p>
<p>By the time Den Dikken provides some motivation for all three of these small clauses and for the various mechanisms that finally ensure word orders and case-marking, his analysis becomes baroque; the biggest questions then concern whether all the various steps in his undeniably careful analysis really have independent justification or plausibility on the basis of other constructions. Two examples: (i) The direct object in <i>To Mary was given a book</i> receives nominative case through a sort of extended chain that involves a case-marked PP in subject position, its trace, and SPEC&ndash;HEAD agreement with this trace inside one of the small clauses (1995c: 119). (ii) Postverbal particles in structures such as <i>send off Bill a package</i> obligatorily incorporate into otherwise empty small clause verbal heads that follow the main verb.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, parts of Den Dikken&apos;s analysis seem convincing. For instance, he constructs some arguments based on Dutch and Chinese for an empty P even in deep structures for double objects without particles (1995c: sections 3.11&ndash;3.13). By cross-linguistic similarity (i.e., using Baker&apos;s Uniformity of Theta Asssignment Hypothesis), he concludes that a lexical Prt can also be null and thus that (64) (cf. his tree (63)) must be part of the general deep structure for English double object constructions:<link rid="fn48">
<sup>48</sup></link>
</p>
<p>(64)<object id="fu14" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu14.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu14_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>Let us examine his proposal that the top SC should be embedded in a third SC&prime; (actually a bare VP) which mediates between the lexical V and the Prt heads. A central motivation for this empty V head above SC in (63&ndash;64) is its role as a target for incorporating the lowest (case-assigning) Goal P, which then assigns case to the Theme NP in <i>send Bob off a package</i>, as illustrated in <link rid="b4">Den Dikken&apos;s (1995c</link>: 133) final labeled bracketing for (63).<link rid="fn49">
<sup>49</sup></link> While the author&apos;s argument may be a legitimate use of <link rid="b12">Baker&apos;s (1988a</link>) Government Transparency Corollary, if we stand back a bit the consequences seem bizarre. The implication is that a P heading a complement (the lower SC) <i>within</i> a clause (the upper SC) can, with enough gymnastics, move into the very head that selects that clause, analogous to operations on a sequence <i>make Bill blame the accident on Harry</i> by which the P <i>on</i> would finally incorporate into <i>make</i>, skipping over <i>blame</i>, and then assign case to <i>Bill</i>.</p>
<p>To us, these machinations bring up the following overriding issue: if Principles and Parameters systems permit such an analysis, with its extra abstract V predicate and attendant complex case-marking and chains of co-indexing, it seems likely that the systems themselves are underconstrained. Alternatively, one could set out to show that such incorporations (i.e., sidestepping of &lsquo;head to head&rsquo; movement) are really needed in a range of other, possibly similar constructions &ndash; or that such incorporations are excluded in principle save in just the case under discussion. But only such wider justifications can dispel doubts about proposals as internally complex as Den Dikken&apos;s intricate case-marking for the Theme NP in a double object construction. We therefore are critical of the additional SC&prime; above the double object deep structure PP in (64).</p>
<p>One might try to eliminate this higher abstract V and retain only two SCs in Den Dikken&apos;s (63&ndash;64) by reworking his case assignment, perhaps by making particles &lsquo;optionally&rsquo; unaccusative. Two reasons for not doing this is that the bolded <i>up the number</i> and <i>the number up</i> will then both be PPs in such classic examples as (65), and they must both be insulated against PP movement, which seems difficult. Small clauses are generally insulated from movement because their subject NP would lack a case-assigner, as discussed earlier; but the sequence <i>up the number</i> should be able to move if it were analyzed as a PP:</p>

<p>A final doubt about an SC account of double objects concerns economy of representation as expressed in (56). If indeed a single PP small clause can encompass both a DO in its specifier, case-marked by a higher head, and an IO complement to its head (e.g., <i>to</i>), why should these two NP arguments of a V ever be realized inside some more complex structure which licenses bare IOs? This question seems to loom over Den Dikken&apos;s &ndash; and other &ndash; small clause analyses of double objects; any such structure that is more complex than a transitive verb with an indirect object marked by a P should be ruled out by Economy.</p>

<heading id="h31" level="3">4.3.1&ensp;Larsonian shells</heading>
<p>Working in a Government-Binding framework, <link rid="b3 b61">Larson (1988b, 1990</link>) makes a proposal for double object constructions now known as a &lsquo;Larsonian shell&rsquo;. He agrees with Relational Grammar in promoting indirect objects to direct object status and demoting the original direct object, thereby expressing the asymmetric c-command required by the paradigms of <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>).</p>
<p>The particularity of Larson&apos;s analysis is its deep structure; the double object construction is a deep VP complement to a higher empty V as in (66). In this complement (i) only the indirect object PP has complement status, (ii) a direct object begins in a deep VP Specifier position, and (iii) the empty head of a postulated higher VP is a landing site for an eventual V-raising. Larson considers the direct object of the double object construction the &lsquo;deep subject&rsquo; of a lower VP. The latter cannot receive case in this position unless the lexical V raises to a position outside the lower VP where it governs and hence can case-mark the NP in this Specifier position:</p>

</p>
<p>Larson derives the double object construction by what he claims to be a passive-like movement of the indirect object. A different execution of this basic idea is proposed in <link rid="b60 b62">Aoun and Li (1989, 1993</link>b), as reviewed in the next subsection.</p>
<p>In Government and Binding terms, the dative operation absorbs or withdraws case from the &lsquo;object&rsquo; of the verb in (66) (that is, the indirect object) and suppresses the theta-role of the &lsquo;subject&rsquo; (the direct object).<link rid="fn50">
<sup>50</sup></link> The deep direct object simultaneously becomes an adjunct of the V&prime;, partly parallel to the <i>by</i> phrase of passives. The indirect object can then move to the &lsquo;VP subject&rsquo; position, analogous to a passivized subject:</p>
<p>(67)<object id="fu16" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu16.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu16_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>When the indirect object moves up to the inner subject position, it asymmetrically c-commands the second NP, and receives case from the raised verb. The adjunct direct object is assigned case by the lowest V&prime;, which is curiously reanalyzed as a V even though it contains a phrasal trace. <link rid="b4">Den Dikken (1995c</link>: <link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>) scrutinizes the possible effects of Larson&apos;s reanalysis, and concludes that it especially faces problems with respect to the English paradigms in which particles combine with double objects.</p>
<p>A number of other oddities result from analyzing a direct object as an adjunct: (i) unlike other adjuncts, the direct object is often obligatory; (ii) it receives case from the head of its phrasal sister (unlike adjunct agent phrases in the standard passive, which require a P); (iii) it freely undergoes successive cyclic A&prime;-movement, counter to a usual restriction on adjuncts (e.g., <i>What did Mary know how to send John?</i>). In contrast, Larson&apos;s derived position for a promoted indirect object is exactly that of a true deep direct object. Consequently, the IO in a double object construction should undergo A&prime;-movement, contrary to the descriptive generalization (29). Larson does discuss some of these problems (1988b: <link rid="ss22">section 3.3</link>), but to our mind unpersuasively.</p>
<p>The widespread adoption of Larson&apos;s complex analysis may be largely due to its compatibility with other influential contemporary ideas. As observed above, <link rid="b2 b66">Kayne (1981c, 1984c</link>) has convinced most syntacticians to limit trees to binary branching, yet his initial recasting of head-initial double object constructions in binary trees led to his rather problematic category labels for double object small clause structures (see <link rid="ss28">section 4.2.2</link>). Alternative binary structures like &lsqb;&lsqb;V &minus; NP&rsqb; &minus; &lcub;NP/PP&rcub;&rsqb;, in which the surface direct object follows and asymmetrically c-commands the indirect object, would wreak havoc with the <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>) paradigms.</p>
<p>Larson&apos;s structure (66) seems to remove these problems, thus clearing the way for binary structures via his structural &lsquo;Single Complement Condition&rsquo;. This basis for binary branching seems like an independent advantage, although its proponents have not seriously addressed a host of other double complement constructions for which the Barss and Lasnik arguments would demand similar treatment. Their properties continue to challenge proponents of binary branching, whatever the correct analysis of double objects.<link rid="fn51">
<sup>51</sup></link>
</p>
<p>Shell structures raise other questions not yet adequately addressed.<link rid="fn52">
<sup>52</sup></link> For example, why can&apos;t the lower VP complement of the empty V in (66) be replaced by an NP such as <i>good ideas</i>, deriving (via head movement of N substituting for the empty V) a word salad something like *<i>John did(n&apos;t)&lsqb;<sub>VP</sub> ideas<sub>i</sub> &lsqb;<sub>NP</sub> good t<sub>i</sub>&rsqb;</i>? Perhaps <link rid="b61">Larson (1990</link>: 597&ndash;598) intends to answer this by the claim that if a V&apos;s arguments &ldquo;can&apos;t be fitted into the minimal VP that it heads, this forces an upward branching of X-bar structure to secure an argument position for the agent.&rdquo; But then this stipulation, to the effect that a shell over an XP &lsquo;can be&rsquo; of the same category XP, should be strengthened to &lsquo;must be&rsquo;. Indeed, rather late in the presentation, <link rid="b3">Larson (1988b</link>: sections 7.1&ndash;7.2) claims that an argument of &alpha; must always be realized within some (possibly higher but presumably adjacent) projection of &alpha;.</p>
<p>Additionally, one wonders if these are the only shells possible. That is, are there also cases of empty-headed APs over APs, etc? Along the same lines, nothing prevents lexical entries from multiplying the number of shells for single items. The Larsonian framework, far from limiting the number of a verb&apos;s complements (as is often inferred from his Single Complement Hypothesis), makes no claim about the maximal number of arguments for a single predicate.<link rid="fn53">
<sup>53</sup></link>
</p>
<p>If <i>send</i> is truly an intransitive verb with an inanimate subject (<link rid="b3">Larson 1988b</link>: 342), we should be seriously rethinking the nature of lexical entries, since apparently the frames of verbs are nothing like what they appear to be. But in fact, is there independent support for treating an indirect object as the sole deep complement of apparent di-transitive verbs? <link rid="b3">Larson&apos;s (1988b</link>: 340&ndash;341) two arguments for such a V&prime; constituent, based on idioms and a suggested closer semantic link between verbs and their indirect objects, are impressionistic and unconvincing (<link rid="b31">Emonds 1993</link>: 220&ndash;221).<link rid="fn54">
<sup>54</sup></link>
</p>
<p>
<link rid="b61">Larson (1990</link>: section 5.3) further argues for his constituent structure with a claim that both gapping and pseudo-gapping can delete a V&prime; constituent which unites verbs and indirect objects in (66). However, finding contrasts in pairs like (68) that would support this claim is difficult; the (a) examples, in which V&prime; deletes, don&apos;t seem to contrast with those in (b), in which V&prime; is supposedly not available:</p>

</p>
<p>Finally, Larson&apos;s case theory is sui generis. He tacitly assumes that the demoted deep object cannot be within a PP, perhaps in deference to the widely shared view that the Projection Principle forbids lowering. Consequently, to explain how a single verb essentially assigns case twice, he assumes that a V assigns both an inherent and a structural objective case. A typical transitive verb is taken to assign both inherent and structural case to its direct object, in contrast to standard variants of case theory. Then, when a double object construction is present, the cases can be split: the indirect object receives structural objective case and the direct object inherent objective case. Within this rather elaborate framework, both cases are suppressed for passive formation, but only structural case for dative shift. Larson also claims that Infl (I) is required for the assignment of objective case, although participles and restructuring verbs (which can be transitive) can be argued to lack I (cf. note 53).</p>
<p>On the positive side, Larson&apos;s analysis accounts for the Barss-Lasnik paradigms in both the base and permuted versions of double object constructions. Moreover, in spite of the marginal role assigned to PP structures, <link rid="b3">Larson (1988b</link>: <link rid="ss37">section 5</link>) provides a valuable discussion of the complementary roles of the contentful English Ps <i>to</i>, <i>of</i>, <i>from</i> vs. the applicative suffixes in other languages (the former typically blocking dative interchange and the latter licensing it). The virtues aside, we have not concealed the fact that we find much to question in this influential account. What seems strange is not the author&apos;s proposal, but the way in which, in spite of their many problematic aspects, Larsonian shells quickly became the standard basis for treating double objects.</p>

<heading id="h32" level="3">4.3.2&ensp;Reversing Larson&apos;s order of arguments</heading>
<p>As discussed in <link rid="ss5">section 2.1</link>, several authors claim that the double object construction indicates a kind of possession of the direct object by the indirect object, even though verbs such as <i>offer</i>, <i>sing</i>, and <i>read</i> make this doubtful. Partly to express this putative property, <link rid="b60">Aoun and Li (1989</link>) propose that double object constructions are small clauses (SC) of indeterminate category, headed by an empty V of possession, as in (69):</p>
<p>(69)<object id="fu17" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu17.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu17_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>How to determine the category label and distribution of this small clause structure is left vague; apparently all and only lexical entries for double object verbs stipulate this type of clausal complement with an SC subcategorization frame. However, the many verbs of transfer that do not allow double objects (<link rid="ss9">section 2.5</link>) will either have quite different complement structures, or the argument interchange in their SC complement (a counterpart to Larson&apos;s &lsquo;passive&rsquo; account of dative movement) must be obligatory for such verbs.</p>
<p>Another problem with (69), which is base-generated for Aoun and Li, is that we would expect the indirect object to freely undergo A&prime;-movement just as subjects of other supposed small clauses do (e.g., in <i>consider John foolish</i>, etc.). But as observed in the discussion of the Restriction on A&prime;-extraction in <link rid="ss11">section 3.1</link>, this is not the case.</p>
<p>Further questions must be asked in order to evaluate the structure in (69). Why should an empty V be restricted to small clauses, when verbs generally occur in all types of clausal structures?<link rid="fn56">
<sup>56</sup></link> As with Larson&apos;s account, what restricts the number of shells contained within each other? Why does the passive form of &lsqb;<sub>V</sub> e&rsqb; mark its postposed subject with <i>to</i> or <i>for</i>, while other passive verbs induce <i>by</i>, and why is there no passive auxiliary in only this new type of passive?</p>
<p>In spite of these problems, the main proposal that <link rid="b60">Aoun and Li (1989</link>) are arguing for is a theory of quantifiers that depends only on the configuration of dominance relations. Our many questions about the labels and provenance of their structures may therefore not seriously undermine their principal hypotheses, which concern the interpretation of quantifiers.</p>

<subsection id="ss34" level="3">
<heading id="h33" level="3">4.3.3&ensp;Lexical alternation in Larsonian shells</heading>
<p>
<link rid="b75">Bowers (1993</link>: <link rid="ss24">section 4</link>) presents a critique of Larson&apos;s proposal to assimilate the dative alternation to that of passives, as well as a revised analysis that circumvents some of the attendant problems. This revised proposal uses a variant of shell structures to account for both the double object and the prepositional dative constructions, but considers the relation between them to be akin to a lexical causative alternation; that is, <i>give</i> with double objects realizes the structure of <i>make IO <b>own/have</b> DO</i>, with <i>give</i> raising from a lower to a higher V position. In comparison, the prepositional construction with <i>give</i> realizes <i>make IO <b>belong</b> to DO</i>, with the double object verb again raising to the V head of the higher VP shell.</p>
<p>Bowers&apos;s main innovation is to revise &ndash; in fact, expand &ndash; shell structures in terms of his study&apos;s general theory of predication, which posits (for small clause constructions as well) an alternating sequence of Pr(edicate)P and VP shells. This alternation is achieved by some phrase structure conditions (1993: 595), which force a sequence of dominance relations (70) in which each phrase&apos;s Specifier position houses an NP argument of the deep lexical verb. The lexical V starts from the lower V position and raises to the higher one, so as to provide case for the &lsquo;inner NP&rsquo; whose surface position is the Spec of the higher VP. According to Bowers, NPs in the double object construction are positioned in the surface as follows, with their roles as subscripts:</p>
<p>(70)&ensp;&lsqb;<sub>PrP</sub><b> NP<sub>SUBJ</sub> Pr</b> &lsqb;<sub>VP</sub><b> NP<sub>IO</sub>
</b> V &lsqb;<sub>PrP</sub> t<sub>IO</sub> Pr &lsqb;<sub>VP</sub><b> NP<sub>DO</sub>
</b> V&rsqb;&rsqb;&rsqb;&rsqb;</p>
<p>The four bold nodes in (70) indicate overt morphemes for a simple sentence such as <i>We sent Mary books</i>.</p>
<p>Bowers is naturally concerned to show that his analysis improves on that of Larson. Thus, he criticizes aspects of Larson&apos;s case-assignment mechanisms and the proposal that the DO in a double object construction is in a transformationally adjoined position; our criticisms of Larson concerning (67) above in this respect recapitulate his. For <link rid="b75">Bowers (1993</link>: 598), Larson doesn&apos;t propose enough structure; rather, all three arguments in a double object construction have properties of underlying subjects (uniformly identified with SPEC positions), as expressed in (70). This structure permits all three to c-command (non-final) floating quantifiers (including crucially <i>We sent the boys all a book</i>; <sup><i>?</i>
</sup><i>we sent John the books all in nice packages</i>; <i>we sent the books all to John</i>); but see note 32. It also permits the &lsquo;outer object&rsquo; to be modified by secondary predication (<i>We sent John the food cold</i>), which is not ordinarily allowed for adjunct NPs.</p>
<p>While it does not come across as the author&apos;s main point, a lexicalist approach to double objects under any guise seems to us to fly in the face of the accumulated cross-linguistic arguments reviewed in <link rid="ss10">section 3</link> in favor of accounting for the dative alternation transformationally. Moreover, while <i>give</i> may well paraphrase both <i>make own</i> and <i>make belong to</i>, we cannot carry the analogy much further: what pairs of causatives are paraphrased by double object verbs like <i>promise</i>, <i>sing</i>, <i>write</i>, <i>butter</i>, <i>carve</i>, <i>cook</i>, and <i>fix</i>? That is, in spite of its rather elaborate transformational raising and phrase structure, including a novel head category Pr uninstantiated in the lexicon, Bowers&apos;s analysis is lexicalist, by his own account (1993: 643&ndash;644).<link rid="fn57">

<heading id="h34" level="3">4.3.4&ensp;Presence or absence of morphological case</heading>
<p>For double objects in Mainland Scandinavian, <link rid="b16">Holmberg and Platzack (1995</link>: 191) posit a deep structure similar to <link rid="b3">Larson&apos;s (1988b</link>), raising the V during the derivation as follows:</p>
<p>(71)<object id="fu18" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">

<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu18.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu18_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>They suggest (1995: 194) that double object constructions are base-generated and are unrelated to what they call &lsquo;<i>to-</i>constructions&rsquo;. This recourse to treating the alternation lexically would in itself seem to be a drawback.</p>
<p>Holmberg and Platzack&apos;s main purpose in discussing double objects is to demonstrate the effects of the presence or absence of &lsquo;m-case&rsquo; (morphological case) in a language. They note that in Icelandic, which has m-case, double objects behave differently from those in Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and English, languages that don&apos;t have m-case. Icelandic direct objects receive accusative case and indirect objects dative, while in the other languages, both NPs have the same (&lsquo;accusative&rsquo;) case. They take the Icelandic facts as evidence that the case on indirect objects is generally not assigned structurally; a conclusion radically at odds with <link rid="b12 b13">Baker&apos;s (1988a, 1988b</link>) assimilating of promoted indirect objects to object position in applicative constructions. In their view, the fact that in Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, the indirect object retains the same case even in passive and expletive sentences suggests that it is behaving in this respect like a PP.</p>
<p>The authors propose that dative case assignment in Icelandic is the result of a lexical selection feature on the verb. In Mainland Scandinavian, it is achieved by a structural case-licensing rule: &ldquo;Accusative is licit in Spec-VP&rdquo; (1995: section 7.4), which recalls a number of Government and Binding analyses which assign accusative case in a lower specifier. Their approach correctly predicts several differences between Icelandic and other Scandinavian languages, based on the presence or absence of this structural case-licensing, and their structures also account for the Barss and Lasnik paradigms. At the cost of an additional special projection &lsquo;ACTP&rsquo; for agents, they in fact remove some of the uncertainty concerning multiple Larsonian shells brought out above. They further argue for their structure by proposing that the indirect object exhibits some specifier properties: for example it cannot be deleted or extracted to an A&prime;-position, as expressed earlier in the Restriction in (29).<link rid="fn58">
<sup>58</sup></link>
</p>
<p>The fact is, most of <link rid="b16">Holmberg and Platzack (1995</link>) focuses on Icelandic double objects rather than on double objects without m-case. With respect to this contrast, we have been following <link rid="b4">Den Dikken&apos;s (1995c</link>) conclusion, cited here in <link rid="ss3">section 1.2</link>, about the difference between German, with m-case, and English, without it; namely, double objects in an m-case system may require fundamentally different treatment from dative alternations in English and other languages. The largest class of Icelandic double objects, those that occur with <i>give</i>-type verbs, do not alternate with a <i>to</i>-construction, unlike English and Mainland Scandinavian. Moreover, the paradigms for movement with Icelandic double objects are almost the opposite of those in other languages. The two Icelandic objects may invert if the indirect object is a heavy NP (cf. notes 17 and 26 for the exclusion of this in Indonesian and English respectively), and either object may passivize under the same conditions. (Holmberg and Platzack suggest that the heavy NP&apos;s status as sentence focus substitutes for the lack of case marker in these sentences.) Any complete theory of indirect objects will, of course, have to account for these contrasts with m-case languages. But the point we developed in <link rid="ss3">section 1.2</link> is that the paradigms with m-case are so different from &lsquo;bare&rsquo; double objects that they are unreliable as a basis for an adequate theory of double objects in languages that lack it.</p>
<p>Holmberg and Platzack&apos;s treatment is thus problematic because it is not so much an analysis of the dative alternation in Mainland Scandinavian (which they take to be lexical) as an argumentation for particular types of VP structures and case assignment. In their framework, the double object construction, which they assume does not include an underlying P, is an apparent problem for their claims. Like Larson, they use case assignment in lower Specifiers to explain the grammaticality of double objects in their framework. This contrasts with analyses that assign case to IOs structurally, by an overt or covert underlying P.</p>

<heading id="h35" level="2">4.4&ensp;Double objects are two arguments in lower NP/DPs</heading>
<p>
<link rid="b76">Johnson (1991</link>) proposes that double object constructions are a type of small clause, following <link rid="b66">Kayne (1984c</link>), with the indirect object acting as the subject of the clause and the direct object acting as a complement. However, the housing of the small clause is a nominal projection, a DP. At least superficially, his structure for double objects and that of <link rid="b49">Hellan (1991b</link>) are the same.</p>
<p>Johnson&apos;s analysis highlights an &lsquo;NP first&rsquo; condition on complements, the requirement that complement NPs appear in English, with very few exceptions, immediately following the verb. He explains this requirement by claiming that main verbs in English move out of the VP they head. NP complements are forced to &lsquo;Object Shift&rsquo; to a specifier of VP to receive accusative case. They must therefore come before PPs or other non-nominals in the VP complement.</p>
<p>The double object construction poses an apparent counter-example to Johnson&apos;s explanation of the &lsquo;NP first&rsquo; rule because it does not explain how the second NP can receive case. To avoid this problem, he therefore suggests that the underlying complement structure for double objects contains a single DP, crucially invoking <link rid="b77">Abney&apos;s (1987</link>) &lsquo;DP Hypothesis&rsquo; for the structure of noun phrases:</p>
<p>(72)<object id="fu19" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu19.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu19_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>He further proposes that an abstract head &tgr; of the encompassing DP is a case assigner, and thereby able to provide case to its complement (the seeming direct object <i>the check</i>).<link rid="fn59">
<sup>59</sup></link> The V then moves out of VP and the first (indirect) object moves to &lsqb;Spec, VP&rsqb; to receive case, as in (73) below, both typical moves in later Government and Binding analyses. This analysis predicts correctly that the first DP in a double object construction will have the position and behavior of a direct object. The structure (72) is also compatible with the Barss and Lasnik paradigms.</p>
<p>Johnson argues that his structure can also explain certain properties of Object Shift in Danish, noted in <link rid="b78">Vikner (1989</link>): both objects may be shifted together or the first object may move, but the second may not. These movement possibilities are expected if both DP objects are part of a larger DP and if the higher inner DP is accessible to movement, much as a subject of a clause.</p>
<p>However, the structure (72) then incorrectly predicts that both objects may move together in English, yielding ungrammatical sentences like <i>*Whom the check did you give?</i> and <i>*My friend the check was given</i>. <link rid="b18">Den Dikken and Mulder (1991</link>: <link rid="ss37">section 5</link>) carefully critique Johnson&apos;s analysis, enumerating paradigms they feel it fails to handle properly. Johnson&apos;s own approach to avoiding &ldquo;double object movement&rdquo; uses a variant of <link rid="b12">Baker&apos;s (1988a</link>) argument that Noun Incorporation can sometimes substitute for case assignment. He incorporates the case assigner &tgr; into the verb&apos;s D-structure position and then Object Shifts the first DP into &lsqb;Spec, VP&rsqb;, as before. When this incorporation is blocked, the &lsquo;big DP&rsquo; in (73), a simplified version of Johnson&apos;s proposed derived structure, must stay in its base position:</p>
<p>(73)<object id="fu20" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu20.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu20_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>The larger DP cannot move in this situation because it contains the trace of &tgr; and cannot move outside its scope without violating <link rid="b38">Chomsky&apos;s (1981</link>: ch. 3) Empty Category Principle. This alternative correctly blocks the movement of both DPs in English, but it would incorrectly block it in Danish. Johnson&apos;s system then has to make &tgr;-incorporation obligatory in English but not in Danish.<link rid="fn60">
<sup>60</sup></link>
</p>
<p>This analysis of double objects has a number of problems, besides the ad hoc properties of the D-head &tgr; in an otherwise unattested type of deep structure DP. For example, it does not address the Restriction (29) on movement of dative NPs to A&prime;-positions, though scenarios for banning A&prime;-bound traces in SPEC might be invoked as in <link rid="b16">Holmberg and Platzack (1995</link>). It is unclear how to relate Johnson&apos;s (72) to the applicative constructions of non-Indo-European languages surveyed in <link rid="ss10">section 3</link>, which share so many properties with English and Scandinavian double object constructions. Nor does (72) tell us why the latter are (close to) synonymous with constructions with overt <i>to</i>-phrases, whose head is unquestionably P (modification by <i>right</i>, stranding behavior, etc.). These problems taken together with those outlined in <link rid="b18">Den Dikken and Mulder (1991</link>) seem to us to render this &lsquo;DP as small clause&rsquo; approach at least in need of serious modification.</p>

<p>Given the twin needs imposed by the Relational Grammar arguments for indirect object advancement (<link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>) and the Barss-Lasnik asymmetry requirements, <link rid="b31">Emonds (1993</link>) reworks his (1972a) proposal that &lsquo;Dative Movement&rsquo; is a structure-preserving transformational interchange of a direct and indirect object (i.e., &lsquo;3 to 2 advancement&rsquo; accompanied by demotion of the direct object). An appropriate Principles and Parameters reformulation of the original construction-specific rule requires that the interchange be sanctioned by UG, but licensed only in languages with some specific lexical property. His analysis uses a somewhat idiosyncratic understanding of the Projection Principle to predict that dative movement is the only possible type of argument interchange.</p>
<p>The proposed lexical property concerns licensing the empty Ps that are &lsquo;deleted&rsquo; in classical dative shift (9), such as English <i>to</i> and <i>for</i>. <link rid="b31">Emonds (1993</link>) claims that these lexical items enter derivations only in PF, and then only in the absence of any dative shift.<link rid="fn61">

<sup>62</sup></link> Like all variants of this Principle, this formulation excludes interchanging any complement with a subject or adjunct or introducing any new ZP under an X&prime;, but it permits interchanging complement NPs (only) around an empty P. Emonds claims this is exactly the formulation that can capture the observed cross-linguistic variation in applicative constructions, which is due to how lexicons license this P.</p>
<p>This structure-preserving interchange of objects satisfies criteria (i)&ndash;(v) in <link rid="ss7">section 2.3</link> for promoted indirect objects in a transformationalist analysis: (i) It accounts for the synonymy of the dative alternations and the cross-linguistic similarity between these alternations and applicative constructions. (ii) While the analysis doesn&apos;t decide issues about proper levels for case assignment, it provides two case assigners for two adjacent NPs. (iii) The analysis promotes indirect objects and thus constitutes a basis for explaining their direct object behavior in applicative constructions (<link rid="ss15">section 3.2</link>). (iv) Regarding the unavailability of the promoted NP for A&prime;-movements (29), see below. (v) Finally, the PP structure in (74) provides asymmetric c-command of the second NP by the first, in both shifted and unshifted sequences, and thus accounts for the <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>) paradigms.<link rid="fn63">
<sup>63</sup></link>
</p>
<p>The underlying PP configuration in (74) is taken to universally define an indirect object, independently of a direct object and the category of the head. If grammatical relations and theta-roles are represented in LF, as is generally assumed, then Emonds&apos;s analysis requires that both deep direct and indirect objecthood and/or the corresponding theta-roles be somehow carried through a derivation. Depending on the design of the transformational computation, carrying such information through a derivation may be problematic.<link rid="fn64">
<sup>64</sup></link>
</p>
<p>A late or PF insertion of Ps such as <i>to</i> and <i>for</i> in the unshifted version of (74) is obligatory because of a general prohibition against unlicensed empty categories.<link rid="fn65">
<sup>65</sup></link> Less straightforward is the obligatory licensing of an empty P in (74) in (only) a shifted or &lsquo;interchanged&rsquo; derivation. Emonds suggests that an empty head, for example P in (74), is co-indexed with its sister in underlying structure. The structure-preserving <i>interchange</i> of NPs, while respecting his Projection Principle, then yields the derived configuration (75), where i is the index of the deep direct object and j of the deep indirect object. His claim is that no preposition can be inserted &lsquo;late&rsquo; in this shifted derivation because a general condition on PF-insertion of a head requires non-distinct indices between heads and complements:<link rid="fn66">

<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu22.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu22_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>The resulting co-indexed structure (75) then accounts for the crucial cross-linguistic Restriction on A&prime;-extraction (29) of promoted indirect objects as follows. If the NP<sub>j</sub> in (75) subsequently moves to an A&prime;-position, <i>both</i> its trace <i>and</i> the empty-headed PP<sub>j</sub> are bound by the same operator. This configuration violates Koopman and Sportiche&apos;s (1983) Bijection Principle prohibiting an A&prime;-constituent from locally binding two empty categories (here NP<sub>j</sub> and &lsqb;P, PATH&rsqb;<sub>j</sub>).</p>
<p>A reviewer has observed that a structure-preserving interchange of double objects does not predict (i) the Scope Freezing of <link rid="ss14">section 3.1.3</link>, (ii) why some English speakers accept immediately postverbal particles with transitive V but not with ditransitive V, or (iii) why second or &lsquo;ch&ocirc;meur&rsquo; NPs passivize in some but not all double object systems. However, it is our impression that, aside from ad hoc stipulations, the competing analyses reviewed here do no better in accounting for these three properties. In particular, as pointed out in <link rid="ss14">section 3.1.3</link>, English Scope Freezing seems to be a property of all &lsquo;A-movements&rsquo;, and is hence irrelevant for choosing among the various A-movement accounts.</p>
<p>Finally, the object interchange in (75), while a necessary condition in this analysis for licensing an empty P, must still not be <i>sufficient</i> to license it, for if it were, every language &ndash; including Romance languages &ndash; would allow dative movement. In order for P &equals; &alpha; to be empty, Emonds proposes that the feature of P (here PATH) must additionally be &lsquo;alternatively realized&rsquo; on a (possibly null) applicative affix &bgr;, as in <link rid="b67">Marantz&apos;s (1993</link>) structure (25a). This possibility is allowed by what he claims is a general principle extending at least to morphology:</p>

<p>Since V and PP are sisters in (75), a closed class affixal head of V (&bgr;) is a potential language-specific locus for an alternatively realized PATH feature of a P (&alpha;).

<heading id="h37" level="1">5&ensp;Conclusion: what we think we know</heading>
<p>In this chapter, we have proceeded through a labyrinth of hypotheses which attempt to explicate an indirect object&apos;s transformationally regular &lsquo;promotion to object&rsquo; in many languages without productive Case-marking, including English, Dutch, Mainland Scandinavian, and several non-Indo-European VO(O) languages. The generative market place, spanning three decades of debate on the resulting &lsquo;double objects&rsquo;, indeed offers a rich choice of highly refined products for treating this challenging raw material. In our tour of this bazaar, we have not been sparing in our criticisms, just as the authors reviewed did not spare their predecessors. (In fact, we only barely mentioned some of these critiques, which can be quite telling.)</p>
<p>At the end, we venture to hold strong opinions about certain &ndash; we dare say established &ndash; cross-linguistic hypotheses, which would defy disconfirmation within even the broadest transformationalist framework. In particular, we are convinced that (i) a structure-dependent theory of abstract case-marking (8) provides superior accounts of double object constructions, and (ii) a null PATH affix akin to overt applicative affixes found outside Indo-European is a good basis for an account of English and Mainland Scandinavian &lsquo;double accusative objects&rsquo;.<link rid="fn68">

<p>There is still some debate over whether indirect object &lsquo;promotion&rsquo; results from transformational movement, but properties of promoted objects discussed in <link rid="ss11">section 3.1</link>, such as the restriction (29) and Scope Freezing, strongly suggest that it does. On the other hand, we have seen in <link rid="ss24">section 4</link> that the field has not convincingly demonstrated the superiority of any particular account of how the direct object in a double object construction comes to be &lsquo;demoted&rsquo;. That is, it has not been able to agree on a formal and yet non-ad hoc characterization of what <link rid="b63">Perlmutter and Postal (1983b</link>) term in Relational Grammar a &lsquo;ch&ocirc;meur&rsquo;.</p>

<number>1&emsp;</number>
<link rid="b1">Fillmore (1965</link>) judges that both objects in the TO-dative double object construction can passivize, while in the FOR-dative neither can:</span>

Similarly, <link rid="b16">Holmberg and Platzack (1995</link>: 189) claim that the Norwegian counterpart of (ii) is acceptable but that the Danish is not. Our judgments suggest a generalization of the latter pattern, namely, the deep direct object can&apos;t be easily passivized in either type of dative:</p>

<p>Because these facts are murky, theoretical studies have not progressed much in differentiating properties of TO- vs. FOR-datives in English.</p>
<p>The analyses of non-Indo-European double object &ldquo;applicative&rdquo; constructions discussed in this chapter all make it clear that indirect objects in double object constructions regularly undergo passivization.</p>
<p>
<span id="fn2">
<number>2&emsp;</number>Chinese resembles the other languages listed in that its Vs precede their NP complements, although in other ways the language is head-final. Since this study concerns V and its objects, we include Chinese.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn3">
<number>3&emsp;</number>Haegeman does not use these terms. Her main theoretical point is to motivate a specific reformulation of &lsquo;Burzio&apos;s Generalization&rsquo;, with which we take no issue.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn4">
<number>4&emsp;</number>For <link rid="b18">Den Dikken and Mulder (1991</link>), Dutch indirect objects are not always related to PPs. They argue that only base-generated bare indirect objects can properly license certain <i>immediately adjacent</i> parasitic gap and secondary predication constructions. However, since the rather robust cross-linguistic results of <link rid="ss10">section 3</link> here suggest PP sources for all indirect objects, they make us wonder whether this adjacency might license predications and parasitic gaps in some other way.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn5">
<number>5&emsp;</number>We return to Holmberg and Platzack&apos;s treatment of mainland Scandinavian in <link rid="ss34">section 4.3.4</link>. We note that they consider an Icelandic &ldquo;inverted&rdquo; double object construction (with IO in final position) to be &ldquo;a <i>to</i>-construction without a preposition but with m-case and focus instead&rdquo; (1995: 207); we agree. Our doubts are limited to their structural parallels between Icelandic and Mainland Scandinavian for the order IO&ndash;DO.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn6">
<number>6&emsp;</number>
<link rid="b22">Zaenen et al. (1985</link>: <link rid="ss24">section 4</link>) claim that certain Icelandic dative-marked objects that undergo the passive are likely to be direct objects. To account for this, they propose a language-particular characterization for Icelandic direct objects: &ldquo;an argument that either immediately follows the verb or is an accusative object.&rdquo; It would be preferable to maintain a universal definition, that a direct object is an NP sister to V. We can then say that this V characteristically assigns accusative but, in Icelandic, V can also assign quirky case to certain direct objects.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn7">
<number>7&emsp;</number>Den Dikken accepts M&uuml;ller&apos;s claim that German indirect objects undergo A&prime;-fronting but argues, contra M&uuml;ller, that this movement should be considered Scrambling and not Dative Movement per se.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn8">
<number>8&emsp;</number>Structure-Dependent Case (8) does not imply that every NP complement overtly marked for oblique case must be in a PP. Single NP objects may be obliquely case-marked without any PP being present (so-called quirky case).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn9">
<number>9&emsp;</number>ZMT (note 13) attributes this trichotomy of case assignment to Hjelmslev and, within Government and Binding, to <link rid="b80">Babby (1980</link>). Some traditional Latin grammar handbooks also reflect this line of thought.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn10">
<number>10&emsp;</number>The statement holds also for Latin&apos;s five-case system if its ablatives and datives, whose forms are in fact always identical in plurals, are analyzed as a single oblique case assigned by P. A theory of autonomous case lacks any basis for explaining this sort of pervasive case syncretism.</span>
</p>
<p>Under this view, the distinct dative singular suffixes in Latin are then oblique case allomorphs required when a governing P is both null and unmarked for the feature SOURCE. (Null Ps which are &plus;SOURCE predictably take the ablative.) It then comes as no surprise that (i) overt Latin Ps can require any case <i>except</i> the dative, and (ii) locative DPs mysteriously surface as dative in a Latin poetic style in which locative Ps can &lsquo;drop&rsquo;. Such consequences are accidental in a scheme of autonomous case.</p>
<p>
<span id="fn11">
<number>11&emsp;</number>Even more restrictively, when a language has no quirky dative direct objects, as in German for example, &ldquo;there should be no DAT&ndash;DAT, DAT&ndash;GEN or GEN&ndash;GEN verbs in that language.&rdquo; ZMT (479) credits <link rid="b37">Czepluch (1982</link>) with making this correct prediction within the GB framework.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn12">
<number>12&emsp;</number>As pointed out by a reviewer, Romance dative clitics on V are not clitics for PPs or Ps. They correspond rather to the DP or D object of an empty P located in an argument or adjunct position. Hence such clitics can have a floating quantifier, as in this French example: <i>Jean leur a tous donn&eacute; des livres</i> &lsquo;John them has all given some books&rsquo;.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn13">
<number>13&emsp;</number>
<link rid="b81">Jackendoff (1973</link>) argues that P may take two complements (NP &plus; PP), as in the bold PP in <i>It was</i> <b><i>down the street to Mary</i>
</b> <i>that he tossed the ball</i>. It is doubtful that a double object of the type studied here could ever appear in a PP, for example, as *<i>It was down Mary the street that he tossed the ball</i>. That is, the double objects under scrutiny in this study appear only inside XPs headed by V.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn14">
<number>14&emsp;</number>There seem to be competing styles with respect to the productivity of the English dative alternation. This study and most of the literature focuses on a more conservative style. However, several observers note a less standard style which allows a dative alternation for any verbs consistent with that style:</span>

<p>Advocates of treating the English dative alternation as an unpredictable lexical phenomenon sometimes contrast examples like (i), perhaps culled from some observed corpus, with unacceptable examples from the conservative style (ii). This confused methodology proves nothing, since the data are not from a single style of speech.</p>
<p>
<span id="fn15">
<number>15&emsp;</number>Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>: 158&ndash;159) accepts the logical non-equivalence of pairs as in (14) but argues that this does not preclude a transformational relation between them; he suggests that the difference between members of a dative alternation concerns aspect, not theta-roles. Similarly, <link rid="b47">Hoekstra (1995</link>: note 5) maintains that &lsquo;affectedness&rsquo; rather than thematic role distinctions differentiates the pairs.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn16">
<number>16&emsp;</number>
<link rid="b61">Larson (1990</link>) notes that in examples like <i>Enrico sang Luisa an aria</i> the theme is &ldquo;for the benefit of the beneficiary.&rdquo; Thus, this example implies a predication that the aria was for Luisa, but <i>Susan ate vegetables for her mother</i> does not imply that any vegetables were for her mother. Since a direct object NP c-commands a PP complement but not an adjunct, it is plausible that LF c-command of one complement by another directly represents a predication, while the non-c-command relation between an object and an adjunct is meaningless.</span>

<link rid="b8">Chung (1976</link>: 54&ndash;56) enumerates many properties of the Indonesian &lsquo;Dative&rsquo; rule (i.e., empirical properties of that language&apos;s double object construction) which exactly mirror the English double object construction.

</p>
<p>But at least some Barss&ndash;Lasnik paradigms involve asymmetric c-command of the second object by the first independently of linear order, as shown in more detail in <link rid="b31">Emonds (1993</link>).

<p>Unlike the objects of P in (ii), objects of <i>to</i> and <i>from</i> can bind anaphors, perhaps because these latter PP structures are deleted in LF.</p>
<p>
<span id="fn19">
<number>19&emsp;</number>Logically, non-alternating double objects as in English (13) are a base construction or they are not. If they are, then dative movement can simply be a structure-preserving subcase of Move &alpha;, using the double NP structure as landing sites. If they are not a base construction, then their only plausible underlying source is indeed an NP&ndash;PP sequence, that is, exactly as in a transformational analysis of the dative alternation. Consequently, in spite of their hold on lexicalist advocates, unpaired double object sentences are irrelevant to the whole debate.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn20">

<link rid="b47">Hoekstra (1995</link>: <link rid="ss4">section 2</link>) first broadly supports and then (sections 5&ndash;7) modifies Kayne&apos;s empty P proposal. He develops a system in which the empty P can have a different status in different Germanic languages, sometimes being only a sort of case-mark on the NP itself.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn22">
<number>22&emsp;</number>This null applicative affix effects what derivational morphology calls &lsquo;conversion&rsquo;, whereby a class of morphemes in one lexical category appears to occur in another (<link rid="b82">Walinska de Hackbeil 1983</link>). For example, English lexical adjectives such as <i>brown</i>, <i>correct</i>, <i>erect</i>, <i>mature</i>, <i>narrow</i>, <i>obscure</i>, <i>open</i>, <i>quiet</i>, <i>round</i>, <i>secure</i>, <i>slow</i>, <i>smooth</i>, <i>steady</i>, and <i>sour</i> can &ldquo;convert&rdquo; to derived verbs by virtue of a null causative affix, akin to the overt causative suffixes -<i>en</i>, <i>-ify</i>, and -<i>ize</i>. (None of these affixes is productive.) Unlike these causativizers, applicative affixes do not change the stem category, but then adjectival <i>-ish</i> and many non-productive diminutive or gender suffixes on N do not change categories either.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn23">
<number>23&emsp;</number>
<link rid="b5">Pesetsky (1995</link>: 129) points out that &ldquo;morphophonological restrictions on affixation are familiar, ranging .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;to syllable-counting restrictions like those on the English comparative.&rdquo; Thus (26) is formally akin to prosaic observations such as: the nominalization suffix -<i>al</i> combines only with final-stressed verbs (<i>arrive</i>, <i>betray</i>, <i>confer</i>, <i>construe</i>, <i>dismiss</i>, etc.); the causativization suffix <i>-en</i> combines only with monosyllables; and the comparative suffix -<i>er</i> is incompatible with non-initial stress or tri-syllabic A. The proposed applicative affix for English also recalls <link rid="b83">Keyser and Roeper&apos;s (1992</link>) proposal that double objects involve a &lsquo;null abstract clitic&rsquo;.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn24">
<number>24&emsp;</number>As pointed out by a reviewer, the null affix may combine with lexically &lsquo;inseparable&rsquo; unstressed prefixes, which perhaps in Modern English have come to include <i>a(d)-</i>, <i>be-</i>, <i>con-</i>, <i>de-</i>, <i>en-</i>, <i>ex-</i>, <i>for-</i>, <i>per-</i>, <i>pro-</i>, and <i>ex-</i>. In other Germanic languages including Old English, such prefixes generally do not interfere with patterns of uniform initial stress. With this proviso, Herriman&apos;s lists of exceptions reduce to a handful of problematic cases: <sup>??</sup><i>telephone your friends an answer</i>, <sup>??</sup><i>guarantee that customer a year of service</i>, <sup>??</sup><i>secure the general the base perimeter</i>.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn25">
<number>25&emsp;</number>As seen in note 1, passivized indirect objects that are beneficiaries (i.e., Fillmore&apos;s <i>for</i>-datives under a movement analysis) are also marginally ungrammatical in some dialects (<sup>?</sup><i>Mary was baked a cake</i>). This rarely discussed and poorly understood restriction plays no role in the following discussion.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn26">
<number>26&emsp;</number>Even though the unacceptabilities are not dramatic, many researchers, including those without commitments to a transformational component, repeatedly reproduce the relevant data in a wide range of English A&prime;-constructions (e.g., <link rid="b56">Ziv and Sheintuch 1979</link>; <link rid="b26">Herriman 1995</link>). Herriman&apos;s massive empirical study refers to rightward extraposition as &lsquo;Position 3&rsquo; and to fronting as &lsquo;Position 4&rsquo; and concludes for indirect objects of her Class 1 verbs: &ldquo;only two examples &lsqb;of Position 3, extraposition&rsqb; were found .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;preceded by the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;object <i>it</i>&rdquo; (1995: 87); &ldquo;initial position in the clauses, is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;of even more doubtful acceptability than position 3, discussed above. Many grammarians .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;exclude this position altogether, while others .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;note that it is highly unusual&rdquo; (1995: 89). Then: &ldquo;No examples were found of class 2 indirect objects in these positions &lsqb;extraposition and fronted&rsqb; in the corpora&rdquo; (1995: 118); &ldquo;none of the corpus examples of class 3 indirect objects occur in positions 3 and 4&rdquo; (1995: 140); &ldquo;No examples were found of class 4 indirect objects in positions 3 and 4 in the corpora&rdquo; (1995: 157).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn27">
<number>27&emsp;</number>Nonetheless, the weak acceptability judgments supporting the generalization (29) are sometimes disputed for some languages or dialects. For example, <link rid="b84">Tuller (1984</link>) indicates that the pattern of (32b) is grammatical in Hausa dative applicative constructions. Thus, the accounts proposed for (29) may have to contain a language-particular dimension.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn28">
<number>28&emsp;</number>
<link rid="b3">Larson (1988b</link>: <link rid="ss7">section 2.3</link>) argues that what <link rid="b55">Ross (1986</link>) terms Complex NP Shift (blocked for prepositionless indirect objects) is not rightward movement of a heavy NP, but leftward movement of a V&prime; called &lsquo;Light Predicate Raising&rsquo;. This term is misleading, as the V&prime; in these cases has no &lsquo;lightness&rsquo; requirement: <i>John &lsqb;repeatedly sent to the girl who had called&rsqb; expensive gifts from Selfridge&apos;s.</i> The unanswered question is why unstressed direct objects block raising of V&prime;, however light V&prime; may be: <i>*John sent to her his.</i>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn29">
<number>29&emsp;</number>Den Dikken further argues that A&prime;-extraction of PP with an empty P is always clause-bound.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn30">
<number>30&emsp;</number>Whitney&apos;s account assumes an early construction-specific formulation of dative movement, so that when the indirect object moves, the deep P of the indirect object in (37) also deletes. The first branching node over the deepest NP trace is then V&prime;; consequently, this trace c-commands any &lsquo;intermediate trace&rsquo; in the promoted IO position. Her account perhaps does not spell out clearly enough this role of the loss of P.</span>
</p>
<p>If movement of the indirect object does not lead to loss of a branching PP, perhaps the explanation for (29) is rather that <i>intermediate</i> traces always contravene Chomsky&apos;s cited principle, by binding potential LF variables in their base position. In fact, this eventuality may account for the exclusion of successive cyclic movement in many languages. Ever since <link rid="b85">Lasnik and Saito (1984</link>), it seems likely that the only intermediate traces permitted are those that for special reasons delete in the derivation of LF.</p>
<p>
<span id="fn31">
<number>31&emsp;</number>As noted in <link rid="b7">Oehrle (1976</link>), the order in (48b) can occur in two circumstances: if the IO is a pronoun or if the particle is <i>back</i>. Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>: section 3.15.2) suggests that such a use of <i>back</i> is part of the DO Theme NP, rather than a head of a complement.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn32">
<number>32&emsp;</number>We do not agree with <link rid="b75">Bowers (1993</link>), for whom it is acceptable to float quantifiers off second objects, as in <sup>??</sup><i>We sent John books all in nice packages</i>. See the discussion in <link rid="ss33">section 4.3.3</link>.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn33">
<number>33&emsp;</number>Although we adopt <link rid="b67">Marantz&apos;s (1993</link>) structural representation (25a) of overt and covert applicative suffixes, his syntactic claims about the structure of double objects strike us as largely arbitrary. Despite the truth-value equivalence of the double object and &lsquo;oblique goal&rsquo; constructions V-NP-PP, he derives them from entirely distinct base structures: &ldquo;the double object constructions will contain two VPs while the oblique constructions contain only one&rdquo; (1993: 120). His justification for distinct base structures in terms of two different &lsquo;event structures&rsquo; is basically discursive rather than evidential. Such a proposal is undermined by the arguments in <link rid="ss11">section 3.1</link> for the derived nature of the double object construction.</span>
</p>
<p>Marantz&apos;s different structures, in which the first NP asymmetrically c-commands the second, do account for the paradigms of <link rid="b45">Barss and Lasnik (1986</link>). But does his analysis achieve anything beyond this? According to his own commentary (1993: 130&ndash;131), neither of these two distinct structures with the V between the two objects accounts for the surface word orders; rather, &ldquo;the linear ordering of constituents is part of the S-structure (SS) to PF interface and not a property of SS.&rdquo; Nor is any explanation provided for the differing syntax of second objects in two groups of double object languages; applicative verbs are said to govern the second NP differently in the two types, but no independent evidence is given for this stipulation other than the point of departure: when the second NPs passivize and undergo object agreement, the applicative verb governs in one way (as in <link rid="b86">Koopman 1984</link>), and when they do not, the structurally identical applicative verb governs in another (as in <link rid="b12">Baker 1988a</link>).</p>
<p>
<span id="fn34">
<number>34&emsp;</number>As he develops his treatment in his <related relationship="sibling" type="samework"><externallink id="chapter 6 - Analytic Causatives.xml" type="file">chapter 6</externallink></related>, Pesetsky finds it advisable to thoroughly recast more familiar conceptions of phrase structure (&lsquo;layered syntax&rsquo;) in terms of his general theory of &lsquo;Cascades&rsquo;, which lies outside the scope of this work. This development affects his conception of how to properly revise (53).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn35">
<number>35&emsp;</number>As further support for his approach, Baker points out that applicative constructions are impossible with verbs that cannot assign case, that is, with true intransitives. The only class of apparent Chiche<object id="fu23" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_21_fu23.gif" type="gif" id="fu23_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>a intransitives allowing applicative formation includes verbs like <i>sing</i> and <i>dance.</i> Verbs in this group often take &lsquo;cognate&rsquo; objects, so presumably they can assign case. Rather than being truly intransitive, they may simply not require a direct object. For further discussion, see <link rid="b14">Alsina and Mchombo (1990</link>).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn36">
<number>36&emsp;</number>Note 28 of <link rid="b31">Emonds (1993</link>) claims that Baker&apos;s final version of case theory has eight stipulative properties. Even if two or three such properties succeed in accounting for cross-linguistic variation (e.g., with respect to when demoted direct objects may be passivized), the residue remains unattractive.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn37">
<number>37&emsp;</number>Overt syntactic incorporation of an argument N does indeed exempt it from the Case Filter, as Baker notes, since the latter is a requirement on surface NPs. Hence the obligatory overt incorporation of otherwise caseless second object in Southern Tiwa would actually seem to confirm the operation of the Case Filter, rather than supporting some kind of exemption from it.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn38">
<number>38&emsp;</number>Principle (3) from <link rid="b2">Kayne (1981c</link>): &ldquo;An anaphor that falls under the binding principles must be connected to an antecedent by an unambiguous path.&rdquo; To the extent that c-command mimics linear order, as is frequent in analyses using binary trees, imposing a requirement that antecedents are found on &lsquo;unambiguous paths&rsquo; amounts simply to saying that an anaphor&apos;s antecedent &lsquo;precedes it&rsquo; somewhere in the string.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn39">
<number>39&emsp;</number>
<link rid="b66">Kayne (1984c</link>) also suggests that Stowell&apos;s (perhaps English-particular) adjacency requirement on V-object case assignment can be derived from binary branching. He claims that &lsquo;&lsqb;V Adv&rsqb; NP&rsquo; is not possible if NP is to receive a theta-role and that &ldquo;V &lsqb;Adv NP&rsqb; is impossible&rdquo; as well. But such structures should then equally well be excluded for the PP complement in the idiomatic (and grammatical) <i>decide quickly on the boat.</i> This grammatical VP then requires either ternary branching or some other stipulation about theta-roles equivalent to (or less general than) Stowell&apos;s adjacency on case-marking. Clearly nothing has been gained; the adjacency condition has <i>not</i> been derived from binary branching.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn40">
<number>40&emsp;</number>Binary branching may well be a serviceable processing principle for projecting adjuncts, coordination structures, external arguments, or the X<sup>0</sup>-internal structure of compounds. That is, it might function as a kind of &lsquo;Elsewhere Condition&rsquo; for tree construction, whenever (56) is not available. But this review concerns precisely those structures for which (56) <i>is</i> available.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn41">
<number>41&emsp;</number>After briefly mentioning some facts of P stranding in Dutch, <link rid="b72">Koster (1978b</link>) formulates his Nesting Hypothesis in terms of forbidding certain material on both the left and right of empty categories. The hypothesis can be better compared to Kayne&apos;s system by limiting it to forbidding material on the right of empty categories.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn42">
<number>42&emsp;</number>Small clauses are not needed for defining LF binding domains or for LF subjecthood. The locality imposed by <link rid="b38">Chomsky&apos;s (1981</link>: ch. 3) Binding Principle A involves the presence of a subject in LF. But subjects are generally defined by means of some c-command relation with a phrasal predicate, and make no reference to whether the node immediately dominating them is clausal or not; for example, a direct object c-commands a secondary predication and hence can be its LF subject.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn43">
<number>43&emsp;</number>Arguments against SC analyses of (57) can also be constructed in terms of gapping. The many studies of this construction in the 15 years following the initial generative study of <link rid="b55">Ross (1986</link> &lsqb;original dissertation 1967&rsqb;) came to a consensus: well-formed gapping constructions contain two remnant phrases as in (i), but not three as in (ii):</span>

<p>Consequently, if SC constituents united direct objects and postverbal particles (or double object sequences), the following gapped clauses would have only two remnant phrases and should hence be well-formed:</p>

</p>
<p>From the marginal status of (iii), one can then only conclude that neither (57) nor double object constructions are best analyzed with single small clause complements.</p>
<p>
<span id="fn44">
<number>44&emsp;</number>The version of <link rid="b73">Koster&apos;s (1978a</link>) Nesting Hypothesis noted in <link rid="ss27">section 4.2.1</link> can account for the ungrammatical extractions from objects inside nominalizations that Kayne attributes to their status as small clause subjects. Unfortunately, a full comparison of possible alternative analyses of nominalizations is well outside the scope of this review.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn45">
<number>45&emsp;</number>From the perspective of small clause advocacy, <link rid="b4">Den Dikken (1995c</link>: <link rid="ss7">section 2.3</link>) also provides a different sort of critique of Kayne&apos;s double object structures, especially those containing particles.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn46">
<number>46&emsp;</number>This requirement of Den Dikken&apos;s on small clauses, that they are actually interpreted as predications, seems to us minimal. Yet many small clause structures proposed by Kayne and other advocates, such as SC analyses proposed for the double complement constructions listed in note 51 below, do not fulfil even this basic criterion of semantic compositionality.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn47">
<number>47&emsp;</number>Cf. tree (52a) in <link rid="b4">Den Dikken (1995c</link>: 132). For explicitness, we replace his SC and XP with PP and P&prime; in accord with his standard view that particles are P. Our use of P&prime; rather than PP is only for making clear the pairings between heads and projections.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn48">
<number>48&emsp;</number>We observe that the existence of an extra empty P in dative constructions, essentially teasing apart PATH P and PLACE P positions in Dutch, does not in itself justify an SC structure encompassing the two NPs.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn49">
<number>49&emsp;</number>The lower P travels further up to the head of SC&prime; after moving from inside the lowest P&prime; in (63). Den Dikken is careful to show how each step conforms to the theory of movement he adopts. He also offers a critique of <link rid="b3">Larson&apos;s (1988b</link>) analysis for not conforming to restrictions on movement.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn50">
<number>50&emsp;</number>Larson treats the preposition <i>to</i> in (66) as a &lsquo;pure&rsquo; Case marker without extra semantic content, which renders it susceptible to absorption. His account does not explain why overt P absorption after indirect object movement is obligatory (*<i>They sent</i><sub><i>k</i>
</sub> <i>John</i><sub><i>i</i>
</sub> <i>&lsqb;</i><sub><i>VP</i>
</sub> <i>t</i><sub><i>k</i>
</sub> <i>to t</i><sub><i>i</i>
</sub> <i>a letter&rsqb;</i>), even though a stranded P can remain after NP preposing in English passives (<i>John</i><sub><i>i</i>
</sub> <i>was &lsqb;</i><sub><i>VP</i>
</sub> <i>spoken to t</i><sub><i>i</i>
</sub> <i>by Bill&rsqb;</i>).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn51">
<number>51&emsp;</number>The wide gamut of double complement structures, many already familiar from <link rid="b87">Chomsky (1965</link>: ch. 2), includes those of <i>promise (Mary to behave yourself)</i>, <i>persuade (Bill it&apos;s raining)</i>, <i>strike (the children</i><sub><i>i</i>
</sub> <i>as dangerous to them</i><sub><i>i</i>
</sub><i>)</i>, <i>prevent (the girls from seeing each other)</i>, <i>say (to every student that he&apos;s brilliant)</i>, <i>speak (two languages to everybody)</i>, <i>seem (to John &lcub;that/like&rcub; it is raining)</i>, <i>remind (Mary of her duties)</i>, <i>rob (John of money)</i>, <i>take (3 hours to eat lunch)</i>, <i>taste (spoiled to John)</i>, etc. In light of the Barss-Lasnik paradigms, the binary branching hypothesis leads to the conclusion that all the preceding parenthesized strings are constituents, presumably small clauses. This conclusion strikes us as a reductio ad absurdum, but seems not to have deterred proponents of binary branching complementation.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn52">
<number>52&emsp;</number>One of the few discussions of some of these issues is <link rid="b61">Larson&apos;s (1990</link>) response to <link rid="b30">Jackendoff (1990a</link>); many authors assume shells as in (66) with no attempt to independently justify them.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn53">
<number>53&emsp;</number>The proposal of <link rid="b88">Roberts (1985</link>) to the effect that any V must keep on raising until it gets to an I doesn&apos;t limit the number of shells; cf. <link rid="b3">Larson (1988b</link>: 343). Moreover, in some fairly well-supported analyses, e.g., of English participles (<link rid="b6">Emonds 1985</link>: ch. 2), no Is are paired with V heads.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn54">
<number>54&emsp;</number>Larson in both articles pursues a rather ingenious account of Heavy NP Shift, claiming the latter doesn&apos;t move; instead, his deep V&prime; constituents, in (66) for example, substitute for a higher empty V <i>(&lsqb;<sub>V&prime;</sub> send to John&rsqb; any book you can find</i>). This V&prime;-raising prima facie violates <link rid="b94">Chomsky&apos;s (1986)</link> restriction against substituting phrases for heads; to avoid this Larson claims it involves &lsquo;reanalysis&rsquo;.</span>
</p>
<p>His exclusion of a shifted indirect object (*<i>send a book any woman who will accept one</i>) is at bottom a stipulation (1988b: 348). Moreover, other instances of Heavy NP Shift (<i>send John tomorrow any book you can find</i>) are unnaccounted for, as pointed out by Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>: note 4).</p>
<p>
<span id="fn55">
<number>55&emsp;</number>Larson claims that pseudo-gapping can derive from a &ldquo;V&prime; constituent that is elided or replaced with <i>do</i>&rdquo; (1990: 629). This seems inadequate, since the <i>do</i> of pseudo-gapping is in an I position, not a V position, as seen in (68).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn56">
<number>56&emsp;</number>It would be strange if a particular grammatical verb, say <i>get</i>, occurred only in one type of clause, say infinitives.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn57">
<number>57&emsp;</number>While Bowers does provide an account of the Restriction (29) on A&prime;-extraction of the IO in a double object construction (and criticizes Larson&apos;s analysis on this count), he must nonetheless stipulate a condition on traces to do so.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn58">
<number>58&emsp;</number>This argument is actually double-edged, since if the authors use the same VP structure with a <i>to-</i>construction, the direct object will be a specifier of VP. But the latter does not exhibit the same specifier properties in the corresponding sentences; that is, it can be extracted to an A&prime;-position. This problem leads Holmberg and Platzack to redefine the direct object so that it is actually a specialized kind of complement. Their proposal is that the direct object can be a complement of V if it is a sister of V&prime; and V has not licensed case in V&prime; (1995: 195). This rule works only if a P is present to assign case to the indirect object.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn59">
<number>59&emsp;</number>One has to hesitate about a D which assigns case to a DP complement. For example, definite articles and demonstratives never seem to assign case. While various authors have proposed that quantifiers such as <i>all</i> and <i>both</i> have DP complements, such structures are unlike (72) because their specifiers cannot be overt DPs.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn60">
<number>60&emsp;</number>We must observe that determiners do not typically incorporate into V in the structures studied in <link rid="b12">Baker (1988a</link>). One may wonder if Johnson&apos;s ideas might not be better served with P rather than D as the head of his single complement, along the lines of Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn61">
<number>61&emsp;</number>
<link rid="b6 b31">Emonds (1985: chs. 4 and 5, 1993</link>) develops a theory of late or PF lexical insertion for both bound and free morphemes that do not contribute to LF.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn62">
<number>62&emsp;</number>The late insertion of <i>to</i> and <i>for</i> as heads of complements crucially uses the fact that the Projection Principle does not hold at the level of PF. These two P must differ by some feature, of course; plausibly, it is LOCATION.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn63">
<number>63&emsp;</number>Since a structure-preserving alternation is a permutation, it necessarily involves two NPs. This may explain why studies of dative and benefactive applicatives (<link rid="b8">Chung 1976</link>; <link rid="b10">Aissen 1983</link>: section 5.1; <link rid="b12">Baker 1988a</link>: section 5.3.2) repeatedly find that indirect object advancement is allowed only with transitive verbs. Analyses such as <link rid="b49">Hellan&apos;s (1991b</link>) and Den <link rid="b4">Dikken&apos;s (1995c</link>), in which bare indirect objects appear only as &lsquo;part of&rsquo; the following direct object, correctly predict this in a different way. <link rid="b14">Alsina and Mchombo (1990</link>: <link rid="ss10">section 3</link>) dispute this generalization on the basis of examples like the following, in which (passivizable) benefactive applicatives seem based on intransitives:</span>

<p>The examples given by these authors involve verbs that are plausibly &lsquo;unaccusative&rsquo;, <i>die</i> and <i>run</i>. If the construction (i) somehow involves an NP-trace in object position, the generalization can perhaps be maintained.</p>
<p>
<span id="fn64">
<number>64&emsp;</number>
<link rid="b31">Emonds (1993</link>) implicitly rejects the inevitability of a trace with every movement. His analysis is more compatible with theta-roles being assigned to complements &lsquo;phase by phase&rsquo;, as they are merged with a selecting head. Such interpreted complements are then present within X<sup>1</sup> throughout a derivation, including by traces if extracted from X<sup>1</sup>. No additional restriction immobilizes them within X<sup>1</sup>.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn65">
<number>65&emsp;</number>We can conclude from <link rid="b10">Aissen&apos;s (1983</link>) treatment that the Tzotzil lexicon lacks an appropriate directional P, thus ruling out the unshifted version: &ldquo;<i>ta</i> is the only preposition in Tzotzil and functions variously to introduce locative, temporal, and instrumental phrases&rdquo; (1983: 287). And: &ldquo;Any derivation in which the final level of structure contains an indirect object &lsqb;i.e., an object of P&rsqb; is ill-formed&rdquo; (1983: 298).</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn66">
<number>66&emsp;</number>It would be perhaps less stipulative to assimilate the empty co-indexed P<sub>j</sub> in (75) to a sort of trace, in the sense that movement generally leaves behind co-indexed covert categories.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span id="fn67">
<number>67&emsp;</number>Another possible locus &bgr; for alternatively realizing PATH (&alpha;) is on a closed-class object of P. Certain grammatical Ds may be &lsquo;inherent dative pronouns&rsquo; with an optional PATH feature, as in the dialectal <i>John gave it me</i> and <i>The book was sent me</i> (Cf. <i>*The book was sent close friends</i>.) Such Ds could stand alone as bare IOs without undergoing dative movement. This may also explain the dialectal possibility allowing &ldquo;short&rdquo; <i>wh</i>-fronting of datives contravening (29), reported in Den <link rid="b4">Dikken (1995c</link>: <link rid="ss26">section 4.2</link>).</span>

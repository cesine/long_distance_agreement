<heading id="h1" level="1">1&ensp;Introduction</heading>
<p>The foundational issues for a correct account of temporal talk in natural language appear uncontentious: we exploit an ontology countenancing temporal entities (time points, time intervals, and/or events) to serve as the referents of such phrases as <i>at three</i>, <i>when John arrived</i>, etc., and of the variables appearing in temporal quantification: <i>often</i>, <i>always</i>, <i>seldom</i>, etc. Those entities are organized in a natural sequence by the earlier-than/later-than relation, which also turns out to be useful to account for our intuitions about the meaning of tenses &ndash; e.g., &lsquo;past&rsquo; contributes that the relevant event/time is before the speech/utterance time &ndash; and of such phrases as <i>John left after his sister entered</i>. The resulting temporal structures seem so natural and intuitive that linguists almost never question them. All we have to do is to use it to discover how temporal reference is managed by language.</p>
<p>However, another view about time in language (and time in general) has exercised scholars for years, originating from concerns expressed by philosophers. According to its proponents, we can, and actually must, dispense with temporal entities, hence with temporal reference. Our temporal talk cannot be analyzed on the model of objectual talk by positing temporal entities ordered by the earlier-than/later-than relation, which, e.g., <i>Thursday</i> or <i>May</i> can draw their reference from, or which tenses relate. The correct approach, it is maintained, requires taking the very idea of tensed thoughts/propositions seriously, meaning that the latter are intrinsically tensed and that tense cannot be explained away by means of precedence.</p>
<p>Though not popular among linguists, such a view has been recently revived and sharpened by <link rid="b1">Ludlow (1999</link>), who proposes a view that strikingly differs not only from &lsquo;strictly&rsquo; referential approaches, but from those based on so-called <i>temporal logics</i> too.</p>
<p>Preference for one over the other account has profound effects on linguistic theory. In the one case, we expect to avail ourselves of the machinery made available to semantics and syntax by the referential view, which includes objectual quantification, referential anaphora, and the referential view of indexicality. If the other path is followed, many of those tools are useless, and something new must be devised. The differences are not limited to semantics, but involve syntax. If we execute the non-referential approach by means of temporal operators for tenses, then <i>de re</i>/<i>de dicto</i> distinctions become crucial. Those, in turn, are usually taken to rely on syntactic operations, which interact with many other such devices, so that evidence in favor or against can be gathered and assessed on syntactic grounds. Similarly, we will see that the two views exploit different syntactic structures for temporal locating phrases such as <i>next May</i> or <i>the Sunday you left</i>.</p>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to stimulate a critical attitude toward issues of temporal reference in linguistic theory, discuss the two alternative views, and start some comparative work. In a way, it is about time to do so. Ludlow&apos;s attempt at making the non-referential, tensed view play a role in the linguistic arena makes it possible to lay down, compare, and discuss the prospects of actual proposals. At the same time, the present work cannot aim at exhausting the comparative work. The difference between the two approaches in terms of available analyses and effort spent by scholars is too big to permit fair comparative assessments. We will be content if a picture emerges which highlights relative weaknesses and strengths of the two views, and if topics to be inserted in the research agenda can be found.</p>
<p>We will proceed as follows. In <link rid="ss3">section 2</link> we provide a cursory review of the basic tenets of the tense-logical approaches. These have the interesting property of exemplifying many of the problems non-referential views have to address, despite the fact that they still rely on ontology of time points, intervals, and the likes. The shortcomings of tense-logical theories have been taken to provide support for fully referential views, which will be the topic of <link rid="ss4">section 3</link>, where phenomena such as the syntax of tenses, sequence of tense, and temporal locating phrases will be discussed. Special emphasis will be placed on the Reichenbachian and on the neo-Reichenbachian view. In <link rid="ss9">section 4</link> we turn to the non-referential, tensed view, by presenting Ludlow&apos;s proposal in some details. To facilitate comparisons, we will focus on the same set of phenomena discussed in <link rid="ss4">section 3</link>, investigating how they can be dealt with in a tensed framework.</p>

<heading id="h2" level="1">2&ensp;Tenses as sentential operators</heading>
<p>Tense logical approaches to time in natural language (cf. <link rid="b2">Prior 1967</link>; <link rid="b3">Montague 1974</link>) consider tenses as sentential operators, which apply to basic (untensed) sentences to yield other, tensed sentences. Semantically, they shift the evaluation time of a sentence to the past or to the future. In the cases we are going to consider, the evaluation time always coincides with the time of the utterance, symbolized by <i>u</i>.</p>
<p>Consider the following examples:</p>

<p>The logical form for (1a) is (1b), where P is the operator for past. Analogously, in the case of a future tense verb (<i>will see</i>), the operator is F. A possible model for this logic is a triple M &equals; (T, &lt;, V) where T is a set of moments of time, &lt; is the binary relation earlier than on T, and V is the interpretation function which assigns a truth-value V<sub>t</sub>(&phis;) to each propositional formula &phis; and to a moment of time t&isin;T. The relevant truth-conditions for the operators P and F are given in (3a) and (3b), respectively:</p>

<p>That is, <i>John saw Mary</i> is true at a time t iff there is a time t&prime; which precedes the time of the utterance and the untensed proposition &lsquo;John see Mary&rsquo; is true at t&prime;. On the other hand, <i>John will see Mary</i> is true when uttered at a time t iff there is a future time t&prime; such that p&equals;&rsquo;John see Mary&rsquo; is true at t&prime;. As can be seen from (3), both F and P have an existential flavor, in that their truth-conditions require the existence of a time at which the proposition they apply to is true. Classical Priorean tense logic also includes the corresponding universal operators G and H, where G&phis; can be paraphrased as &lsquo;in the future it will always be the case that &phis;&rsquo;, and H&phis; as &lsquo;in the past it has always been the case that &phis;&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Importantly, tense operators can be combined to yield more complex configurations. Such a possibility has been exploited to capture the meaning of compound tenses such as the English pluperfect, which could be seen as the composition of two past operators, PP, and of the future perfect, represented as PF.</p>
<p>The tense operator approach has been criticized from both an empirical and a theoretical point of view. We will consider some of these criticisms, namely those discussed by <link rid="b4">En&ccedil; (1986</link>), and others arising from observations originally made by <link rid="b5">Kamp (1968</link>).</p>
<p>If tenses are operators, we expect them to exhibit scope properties analogous to those of other operators and quantified expressions, such as DPs. Consider (5) (cf. <link rid="b4">En&ccedil; 1986</link>: ex. 3):</p>
<p>(5)&ensp;All rich men were poor children.</p>
<p>The meaning of (5) can be paraphrased as in (6):</p>
<p>(6)&ensp;All rich men (past and present ones) were at a previous time poor children.</p>
<p>The logical forms for (5) are given in (7):</p>

</p>
<p>The verb <i>were</i> instantiates a past operator <i>P</i>. Furthermore, in (5) the universally quantified DP <i>all rich men</i> appears. Given that operators manifest scope properties, we expect the temporal operator <i>P</i> to interact with the quantified DP, each possibly taking scope on the other. Consider the case where the universal quantifier has wider scope, thus yielding (7a). The corresponding proposition is true iff for every <i>presently</i> rich man x there is a past time at which x is a poor child. This is not the meaning of (5), according to our intuitions, because it takes into account only presently rich men. If we let the tense operator take scope over the universal operator, (7b) is obtained, a proposition which is true iff there is a past time t such that every man who is rich at t is also a poor child at the same past time. Again, we are far from the meaning of (5) as expressed by (6). Thus, both scope possibilities fail to capture (5), and it seems that a standard account of the scope interactions of a tense operator with quantified expressions does not suffice to obtain the correct result (for more recent work about the temporal properties of noun phrases, see <link rid="b6">Musan 1995</link>).</p>
<p>It also has been observed that tense operators introduced by verbal morphology are not sufficient to account for some interpretive facts. Consider, for example, the following sentence (<link rid="b4">En&ccedil; 1986</link>: ex. 13):</p>
<p>(8)&ensp;Every fugitive is now in jail.</p>
<p>The operator approach assigns (8) the following meaning:</p>
<p>(9)&ensp;Every x who is now a fugitive is presently in jail.</p>
<p>Example (8), however, is an assertion about past fugitives who are presently in jail. The correct truth-conditions are exemplified by (10):</p>
<p>(10)&ensp;&forall;x ((P(fugitive(x))) &and; in-jail(x))</p>
<p>To obtain (10), it must be assumed that the past tense operator P is instantiated by the subject DP. Notice in fact that the verbal tense is present and therefore cannot be the verb which instantiates the operator. Moreover, the scope of the operator should not include the predicate and should be restricted to the subject. Generally, however, tense operators are introduced by tense morphemes related to the verbs and have the predicate in their scope. In (8) and similar cases, there is no such past tense morpheme &ndash; that is, there is no morphosyntactic evidence of its presence and there is no obvious way to constrain the scope of this operator to the DP. In principle, in fact, an operator associated with the DP could take scope over the whole sentence. In this case we would obtain (11):</p>
<p>(11)&ensp;&forall;x (P(fugitive(x) &and; in-jail(x)))</p>
<p>Example (11) is true iff everyone who was a fugitive at a past time was in jail at the same time. Again, such a reading is not the correct one. Therefore the hypothesis according to which DPs introduce tense operators does not make the correct predictions, because the scope properties of such operators are anomalous and should be constrained by means of ad hoc conditions. Consider also that if it were correct to hypothesize the presence of an operator taking scope over the DP, we should also investigate the scope relations between two DPs, each bearing its own temporal interpretation (and, consequently, its own tense operator). In particular, when a DP is c-commanded by another one, we would expect the temporal interpretation of the former to depend on the temporal interpretation of the latter. Consider the example in (12) (modeled on <link rid="b4">En&ccedil; 1986</link>: ex. 8):</p>
<p>(12)&ensp;Every student will have met a president.</p>
<p>A possible reading of (12), which is the one relevant to our discussion, is the following: let us hypothesize a scenario where every present student either met, or is meeting, or will meet at a future time the president in charge at that moment. Sentence (12) is true at the utterance time if there is a later time at which <i>every student met a president</i> is true. In this scenario, the DP <i>every student</i> is evaluated at the present time, whereas <i>a president</i> can be evaluated at a past, present, or future time. That is, the times relevant for the two DPs must be kept separate, so that the temporal interpretation of the DP <i>a president</i> does not depend on the interpretation of the DP <i>every student</i>, even if <i>a president</i> is in the scope of the latter. As a consequence, the expectation that tense operators introduced by DPs exhibit the scope properties of ordinary quantified expressions is not met.</p>
<p>To summarize, tense operators introduced by DP do not take scope over the main predicate, as shown by (10), and they do not interact with each other, as shown by our discussion of (12). If we still want to maintain the hypothesis that a DP can be associated with a tense operator, we should constrain such a tense operator to take only very local scope, because it seems to have only the DP itself in its scope. As we said in the preceding discussion, this move is possible, but requires a rather ad hoc hypothesis.</p>
<p>Another argument against the use of tense operators comes from the analysis of the interactions between tenses in complex sentences. Consider (13), due to <link rid="b5">Kamp (1968</link>):</p>

</p>
<p>(14)&ensp;P(&exist;x (child(x) &and; born(x) &and; F(king(x))))</p>
<p>The sentences in (13a) and (13b) differ only in the use of two different future forms in the relative clause; namely, the auxiliary <i>would</i> vs. <i>will</i>. The logical form in (14) represents the meaning of (13a). The future tense operator, introduced by the verb of the relative clause, is in the scope of the tense operator of the main verb. Formula (14) is then true iff there is a past time t at which a child was born and there is a time future with respect to t when it is true that the child is king. Thus, (14) correctly captures the meaning of (13a). On the other hand, it is not so easy to account for the meaning of (13b), the version in which the simple future, <i>will</i>, appears in the relative clause. Formula (14) does not work, for (13b) requires the time at which the child is said to be king to be in the future with respect to the utterance now, something which is not made available by (14). There is an alternative option; namely, that the future operator takes scope over the matrix clause past operator, yielding (15):</p>
<p>(15)&ensp;FP(&exist;x (child(x) &and; born(x) &and; king(x)))</p>
<p>Formula (15), however, is not a correct representation of (13b) either, since it requires a future time t and a time t&prime;, t&prime; &lt; t, such that born(x) and king(x) are both true at t&prime;. What is needed for (13b) is the possibility for the two tenses to be independently evaluated with respect to the utterance time. Tense logic, however, cannot represent the two operators as being independent from each other.</p>
<p>The examples in (13) raise a problem very similar to those discussed by En&ccedil;. One major inadequacy of the tense operator approach seems to be that the interactions among the temporal properties of the constituents of a sentence are not the ones expected for tense operators. In other words, an operator-based representation is insufficient to account for the temporal interpretation of the sentences considered above.</p>
<p>Another problem with the tense logical approach is the possibility of compounding the basic operators F and P to yield more complex ones. On the one hand, languages like English have tenses that seem to be naturally analyzable by means of such a property. For instance, the pluperfect and the future perfect could correspond to PP and FP, respectively. On the other hand, there are compound tenses that resist a similar treatment. For example, the present perfect cannot be straightforwardly distinguished from the simple past by virtue of operator compositions.</p>
<p>Another problem is that nothing prevents an unlimited composition of tense operators. Any sequence is a priori possible &ndash; e.g., FPF, PPP, FPFP, etc. &ndash; even if none of them corresponds to an observable tense in any language. The composition of operators could be constrained by means of ad hoc conditions, for instance, by explicitly disallowing combinations of more than two operators. This move, however, weakens the explanatory adequacy of the temporal logic approach.</p>
<p>Finally, tense logical approaches have notorious problems with the treatment of temporal anaphora. Consider (16) and (17):</p>
<p>(16)&ensp;John left the room. He was furious.</p>
<p>(17)&ensp;John said that Mary was pregnant.</p>
<p>In (16) the second sentence is understood as holding at the same time as the first. Example (17), on the other hand, can either mean that Mary&apos;s pregnancy holds at the time of John&apos;s utterance, or that the pregnancy is at an earlier time. Thus, both in (16) and (17) there seems to be a dependency of the time of the second clause (<i>he was furious</i> and <i>Mary was pregnant</i>) on the time of another clause.</p>
<p>The operator approach cannot easily account for the facts in (16) and (17). Anaphoric phenomena, in fact, seem to require the availability of entities, such as times and events (but also ordinary individuals referring to spatial objects), which can be introduced in the discourse context, stored, and accessed for later reference. No natural notion of context is possible with tense logic, unless major changes are proposed, undermining the spirit of these logical systems (for a discussion, see <link rid="b7">Kamp and Reyle 1993</link>). Furthermore, although tense logic does make use of temporal entities, it does so at the level of the metalanguage, in the truth-conditions for operators. Hence, there are no terms referring to temporal entities in the object language (cf. the logical forms given above). This way of encoding the temporal dimension was motivated by considerations about verbal tenses, since their intrinsic relational meaning can be captured by means of truth-conditions such as those in (3), repeated here for simplicity:</p>

</p>
<p>Verbal tense, however, is not the only manifestation of time in natural languages, and there are cases in which direct reference to temporal entities seems to be needed. Apparently, this is the case of temporal anaphora, as seen, and presumably also of temporal adverbials such as <i>at four</i>, <i>yesterday</i>, and so on. There are, therefore, many cases where direct reference to times appears to be necessary.</p>

<subsection id="ss4" level="1">
<heading id="h3" level="1">3&ensp;Temporal entities</heading>
<p>In the previous section we have shown that (i) the temporal properties of sentences cannot be easily accounted for by means of the scopal dependencies among temporal operators; (ii) the compositional character of temporal operators does not provide an upper limit to the number of temporal operators which can be combined to yield tenses, failing therefore to explain the limited variety of tenses found in natural languages; and (iii) tense logic does not provide an account of temporal anaphora and of certain expressions that seem to require the availability of terms referring to times. All these considerations seem to favor a referential approach &ndash; that is, an approach that allows temporal reference directly in the object language, thus permitting an analysis of tenses, and temporal adverbials as referring (or involving reference) to temporal entities. Before turning to more details about the referential approach, let me emphasize that the basic opposition between the temporal logic approach and the so-called referential one is linguistic, not ontological-metaphysical. That is, both admit the reality of times (points, intervals, or whatever) with their usual properties (precedence). The difference is in the logical language: in one case, terms referring to those entities are exploited; in the other, reference to times is relegated to the metalanguage. As we will see, there is a more radical option, which expunges times from all levels of the logical language, prohibiting reference thereto tout court.</p>
<p>Before we continue, let us point out that we will often cast our consideration in a truth-theoretic semantic framework, inspired by the work of <link rid="b8">Higginbotham (1991</link>) and <link rid="b9">Larson and Segal (1995</link>). For obvious reason, there is no space here to discuss the approach in any detail, and the interested reader is referred to the publications cited. For our purposes, it suffices to say that the theory uses a ternary relation Val, between an entity, x, a linguistic object, &Sigma;, and an assignment sequence, Val(x, &Sigma;, &sigma;), signaling that x is a value for &Sigma; under assignment &sigma;, and that this will be the basic building block for our semantic work.</p>
<p>We start by considering how tenses can be accounted for in a referential approach. The simpler possibility is to have them introduce relations between temporal entities; e.g., the past tense states that the time of the event precedes the time of the speech. Or, alternatively, that the event talked about in the clause precedes the speech/utterance event. Syntactically, tense morphemes are of category T, project a constituent TP, and take VP complements. Hypothesizing that both the latter are predicates of events, we could write the following axioms for T:</p>

</p>
<p>They say that, for a given assignment sequence &sigma;, the value of a tense morpheme is event e iff such an event precedes the utterance (past tense), overlaps the utterance (present tense), or follows the utterance (future tense). The event is provided by the VP, and the combination of the tense with that phrase is ruled by the following axiom:</p>
<p>(20)&ensp;Val(e, &lsqb;<sub>TP</sub> T VP&rsqb;, &sigma;) iff Val(e, VP, &sigma;) and Val(e, T, &sigma;)</p>
<p>This axiom says that event e is a value of &lsqb;<sub>TP</sub> T &lsqb;<sub>VP</sub> ran&rsqb;&rsqb; iff e is the value of the VP and of the node T. The axiom for the relevant tense, (19b), eventually constraints the event to precede the utterance.</p>
<p>It has been observed that this simple picture is not easy to extend to compound tenses. To this end, it might be worth considering the work done in the Reichenbachian tradition, starting from <link rid="b10">Reichenbach (1947</link>). In this perspective, the correct temporal interpretation of tenses requires three temporal entities, not just two, adding the so-called reference time/event, r, to the already-seen event (time) and utterance (time). With this, tenses are devices ordering the three temporal entities. For example, the meaning of the present tense could be represented as u&deg;r&deg;e, stating that the event (time) overlaps the reference time/event, and the latter overlaps the utterance.</p>
<p>The Reichenbachian model has been adopted and revised by several linguists (among others, <link rid="b11 b12">Comrie 1976a, 1985b</link>; <link rid="b13">Vikner 1985b</link>; <link rid="b14">Hornstein 1990</link>; <link rid="b15">Scorretti 1991</link>; <link rid="b16">Declerck 1986</link>; <link rid="b17">Giorgi and Pianesi 1997</link>). As already suggested by Reichenbach and then further discussed by <link rid="b12">Comrie (1985b</link>) and <link rid="b14">Hornstein (1990</link>), for both empirical and theoretical reasons it has been proposed that the relation among the three points be split into two distinct relations, one between r and u, and the other between e and r. The result is a system in which a direct relationship between e and u is never realized, but is always mediated by r. The possible relations are the following:</p>

</p>
<p>As a consequence, the various tenses are the result of the composition of a relation of type 1, with a relation of type 2. For instance, according to this picture, the representation of the present tense is the result of the combination of u&deg;r with e&deg;r, to yield u&deg;r&deg;e. The representation of the present perfect is the result of the combination of u&deg;r with e&gt;r, to yield e&gt;r&deg;u. From the point of view of the final representation, this proposal exhibits an important empirical difference with respect to the original Reichenbach one. The point, often discussed in the literature (see <link rid="b12">Comrie 1985b</link> and <link rid="b14">Hornstein 1990</link>), concerns the future perfect. Such a tense results from the combination of u&gt;r and e&gt;r. Comrie points out that in English (and in Italian as well), a sentence such as (22) is ambiguous in three ways:</p>
<p>(22)&ensp;John will have finished his manuscript by tomorrow.</p>
<p>The exact temporal relation between the finishing of the manuscript and the utterance is unknown. It could be that when the sentence is uttered, John has already finished the manuscript; or that he is finishing it exactly at that moment; or that he will finish after the utterance and before <i>tomorrow</i>. This ambiguity is nicely captured by the following combination of type 1 and type 2 relations:</p>

</object>
</p>
<p>As pointed out by Comrie and then by Hornstein, the revised Reichenbachian framework presents several other advantages over the original one. According to the latter, in fact, we would in principle expect the existence of languages where for each possible position of e, there is a morphologically different realization. In other words, Reichenbach predicts the existence of languages in which the meanings corresponding to u&gt;e&gt;r, u&deg;e&gt;r, e&gt;u&gt;r are expressed by means of different morphological tenses. Comrie points out that this does not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Also, we have a way to account naturally and elegantly for the limited number of morphologized tenses, a problem that plagued the tense operator approach of the previous section. The system is based on three primitive objects plus binary relations. As such, the possibilities of combining the various forms are very limited. Finally, as pointed out by <link rid="b14">Hornstein (1990</link>), such a system can be easily acquired, satisfying therefore an important requirement for any theory of tense. The inventory of resulting tenses is the following (the list is basically <link rid="b14">Hornstein&apos;s (1990</link>: 117) with the addition of the distant future):</p>

<heading id="h4" level="2">3.1&ensp;The syntax of tense</heading>
<p>Given the revised Reichenbachian framework reviewed in the previous section, the possibility arises that the two types of relations between temporal entities correspond to two Tense head, T1 and T2, realizing type 1 and type 2 relations, respectively. Such a distinction can be motivated by showing that the morphemes realizing T1 and T2 have different contents, in terms of features and different morphosyntactic behaviors, and that this predicts the legitimate combination of these two categories, hence of available tenses.</p>
<p>This possibility has been pursued in <link rid="b17">Giorgi and Pianesi (1997</link>), where it is proposed that tenses are doubly represented in clausal structure because of the existence of two projections, T1 and T2, with T1 higher than T2. For example, a compound tense such as the Italian or English past perfect (e.g., <i>had eaten</i>) or future perfect (<i>will have eaten</i>) would correspond to (at least) the following structure:</p>
<p>(25)&ensp;<object id="fu2" type="figure" position="fixed" format="inline">
<objectsource>
<file name="Graphics\chapter_72_fu2.jpg" type="jpg" id="fu2_source"/>
</objectsource>
</object>
</p>
<p>Here, T1 introduces the relation between the utterance and the reference point, whereas T2 takes care of relating the latter to the event. The lower VP is projected by the verb, whereas the higher one is projected by the auxiliary. AGR1 represents the set of phi-features, e.g., person and number, that are shared with the subject, i.e., (Spec, AGR1&Prime;). AGR2 can be specified for gender and number features, as in Italian. Giorgi and Pianesi hypothesize that there are no &Oslash; tense heads, and that the representation for an Italian present tense form is the following:</p>

<p>No T1 or T2 node is projected, and the meaning usually associated with the present tense results from a default process directly relating the event (introduced by the verb) and the utterance, yielding u&deg;e. The idea is that, tenses being a semi-lexical category, they are present in syntax only if morphological evidence is available. In other cases, only T1 is projected, as in the Italian simple past:</p>

<p>Here T1 directly relates the event (introduced by the verb) to the utterance, yielding e&gt;u. Finally, the present perfect is as in (28). T2 is projected, and connects the event to the reference time/event, giving e&gt;r. T1, on the other hand, is absent, since the auxiliary is in the present tense. As before, this triggers a default interpretation according to which the reference event overlaps the utterance. This way we obtain the expected result: e&gt;r&deg;u.</p>

<p>As can be seen, Giorgi and Pianesi assign a bi-clausal structure to complex tenses, and treat the contribution of T1 and T2 in essentially the same manner. A past tense, be it expressed by T1 or T2, places the (entity corresponding to the) variable instantiated by the complement of the tense node before another entity (the reference time/utterance event). The lower clause is responsible for relating the event (time) and the reference time/event. The upper clause handles the latter variable, relating it to the utterance. This can be captured as follows:</p>

<p>We have avoided using the variables e and r in (29) to stress the strong symmetry between the two tenses. Thus, when T2 is realized by a past tense morpheme, (29a) and (29b) jointly ensure that the value of T2P be an entity (the reference event) that is before the entity introduced by the VP (the event). Moreover, if T1 is a future morpheme, then the value of T1P is the entity realized by the VP, the latter turning out to be the same as the value of the embedded T2P. As before, the indexical nature of T1 tenses is handled directly by axiom (29d).</p>
<p>Those axioms provide a simple treatment of the second variable (the reference time/event). A more detailed account should accommodate the fact that it can draw its reference from the contexts, or be bound by a quantificational expression, as in:</p>

<p>The variable corresponding to r can be both a temporal entity &ndash; a time point or interval &ndash; and an eventuality, according to the framework adopted. The second possibility enables us to introduce considerations about consequent states, a l&agrave; <link rid="b18">Parsons (1990</link>). The first alternative can be used to accommodate within this theory insights relying on the notion of an extended now, as in <link rid="b19">Dowty (1979</link>). Finally, notice that in this approach the three Reichenbachian points lose any privileged status and become a side effect of the interplay between the syntactic and the semantic properties of tense morphemes, and the structures they enter into.</p>
<p>Other authors have elaborated on the idea of bi- (and even multi-) clausal structure for tenses. Thus <link rid="b20">Julien (2001</link>) proposes that simple sentences involve both a TP-past and a TP-future, the former taking the second as its complement, and the latter the VP. Both T-past and T-future can have &plusmn;values:</p>
<p>(31)&ensp;&lsqb;<sub>TP-past</sub> T-past<sub>&lsqb;&plusmn; past&rsqb;</sub> &lsqb;<sub>TP-future</sub> T-future<sub>&lsqb;&plusmn;future&rsqb;</sub> &lsqb;VP&rsqb;&rsqb;&rsqb;</p>
<p>When T-past has &lsqb;&plus;past&rsqb; and T-future has &lsqb;&minus;future&rsqb; the result is a simple past. Vice versa, if T-past is &lsqb;&minus;past&rsqb; and T-future is &lsqb;&plus;future&rsqb;, we have a simple future. The present tense results from a configuration where both features have the value &minus;, and, as in Giorgi and Pianesi, the relevant interpretation is the result of a default process. Finally, Julien admits the possibility that both features have a &plus; value, exemplifying this possibility with the English future in the past <i>would</i>. This structure is extended to complex tenses by duplicating the structure below the auxiliary in (31). Other proposals in this direction can be found in <link rid="b21">Cinque (1999</link>). For a partially different view, see <link rid="b22">Stowell (1996</link>).</p>
</subsection>
<subsection id="ss6" level="2">
<heading id="h5" level="2">3.2&ensp;Sequence of tense</heading>
<p>Up to now, our discussion of the referential theory has been limited to tenses in matrix clauses. In complement clauses, especially when predicates of propositional attitude are involved, tenses behave in peculiar ways, giving rise in languages such as English to so-called Sequence of Tense (SOT) phenomena. Thus, an utterance of (32) can be understood as reporting either a present tense utterance of John&apos;s &ndash; e.g., <i>Mary is ill</i> &ndash; or a past tense utterance &ndash; e.g., <i>Mary was ill</i>:</p>
<p>(32)&ensp;John said/believed that Mary was ill.</p>
<p>Within the approach under discussion here, the backward-shifted reading can be captured by assigning (32) the following truth-conditions:</p>
<p>(33)&ensp;&exist;e(saying(e) &and; Agent(e, John) &and; Theme(e, &psi;) &and; e&lt;u)</p>
<p>Here, &psi; is the ILF for the subordinate clause with the following truth-conditions:</p>
<p>(34)&ensp;&exist;e&prime; (ill(e) &and; Theme(e&prime;, Mary) &and; e&prime;&lt;e)</p>
<p>Once the two are put together we have:</p>
<p>(35)&ensp;&exist;e(saying(e) &and; Agent(e, John) &and; Theme(e, &lsqb;&rsqb;&exist;e&prime; (ill(e) &and; Theme(e&prime;, Mary) &and; e&prime;&lt;e)&lsqb;&rsqb;) &and; e&lt;u)</p>
<p>What is important here is that the truth-conditions for the subordinate clause explicitly mention the episode of saying, letting the tense relate it to the embedded eventuality (the illness); see <link rid="b23">Higginbotham (1995</link>) for more on this topic. This establishes a parallel between the role the matrix eventuality &ndash; the subject&apos;s attitude episode &ndash; plays in the subordinate clause and the role played by the utterance in the matrix. In both cases, the tokening of an expression by an agent is used as a temporal coordinate from which the tense&apos;s contribution is computed. This parallel can be further pursued, as in <link rid="b24 b25">Giorgi and Pianesi (2001a, 2001b</link>), to account for the lack of mere indexical readings of tenses in subordinate clauses. Thus, (36) cannot be used to mean that John said something concerning the very time (36) is uttered &ndash; that is, the speech time &ndash; nor can (32) be used to report a dictum concerning events which are located in the past only with respect to the utterer &ndash; e.g., yielding a report which is future-oriented with respect to John:</p>
<p>(36)&ensp;Last week John said that Mary is pregnant.</p>
<p>It seems, therefore, that whenever there is a tokening of a linguistic expression (as in matrix clauses), or a report about such a tokening (as in subordinate contexts), the temporal coordinates of the tokener must be explicitly given and connected to the event the expression is about. In other words, the ILF representing the object of a propositional attitude must explicitly represent the attitude episode itself, and use it to locate the talked-about event:</p>

<p>Principle (37) correctly predicts that tenses in subordinate contexts cannot be mere indexicals, for that would amount to linking the event to the utterance, hence to the speaker&apos;s coordinate, violating (37). Moreover, it dissolves the notion of <i>temporal anchoring</i> (cf. <link rid="b26">Enc 1987</link>) into the more general requirement that the contents of propositional attitude explicitly represent the attitude episode itself. Finally, it suggests that the assignment sequences that are used to compute the interpreted logical forms of clauses subordinated to verbs of propositional attitude had better be relativized to subjects. By this we mean that in the backward-shifted reading, the <i>was</i> of (32) is evaluated as if it were the subject&apos;s (John&apos;s) <i>was</i>, hence relating the state of illness to his coordinate &ndash; i.e., the saying/thought &ndash; rather than to the speaker&apos;s &ndash; i.e., the utterance. We do not discuss here how this idea can be implemented, for which we refer the reader to <link rid="b25">Giorgi and Pianesi (2001b</link>). Suffice it to say that the availability of subject-oriented assignment sequences provides for the desired truth-conditions (33) and (35).</p>
<p>Turning to the simultaneous reading of (32), it can be given the following truth-conditions:</p>
<p>(38)&ensp;&exist;e(saying(e) &and; Agent(e, John) &and; Theme(e, &lsqb;&rsqb;&exist;e&prime; (ill(e) &and; Theme(e&prime;, Mary) &and; e&prime;&deg;e)&lsqb;&rsqb;) &and; e&lt;u)</p>
<p>They are consistent with the discussion above and with (37): the ILF of the subordinate clause explicitly represents the subject&apos;s temporal coordinate, and the tense relates this to the event. As before, this is obtained by computing the ILF of the subordinate clause by means of a subject-oriented assignment. With respect to the other reading, however, the well-known problem arises of how to accommodate the fact that an embedded past tense of (32) behaves as if it were a present tense. Roughly speaking, the explanations provided by the literature are of two different kinds. According to one view, the embedded past tense is only &lsquo;apparent&rsquo; in (32); one might argue, in fact, that it is present during part of the derivation, but then disappears at LF, because of some deletion process obtaining in past-under-past contexts. Another view maintains that the past tense morpheme was not present during the derivation, and got inserted only as a by-product of spell-out. Both views share the idea that the LF representation for a (32) can have a &Oslash; tense morpheme (or no tense morpheme at all), which interpretively yields &ndash; e.g., through some default mechanism &ndash; simultaneity. This approach was quite popular some times ago. More recently, it has been exploited by <link rid="b27">Ogihara (1995</link>), though it has lost some of its appeal because it requires postulating mechanisms (deletion and/or insertion) that are not so readily available any more.</p>
<p>Another tradition has it that the past tense is morphologically present, but can be interpretively transparent, either because the embedded past tense enters some kind of agreement process with the matrix one, or because it acts as a scope marker for the matrix tense, or some similar mechanism. A recent proposal in this direction is that advanced by <link rid="b28">Abusch (1997</link>). She hypothesizes that superordinate tenses can place constraints on subordinate ones, and that, vice versa, subordinate tenses inherit restrictions from superordinate ones. Thus she speaks of a local relation together with transmitted ones. In the case of a past-under-past sentence, the constraint is that at least one of these relations taken together (the local and transmitted ones) is temporal precedence. More precisely, she assumes that:</p>

<p>Given this, the simultaneous reading of (32) follows: (i) the constraint on the subordinate past tense is satisfied by the inherited precedence relation, and (ii) this makes it possible to understand the embedded event as simultaneous to the saying.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that pursued by <link rid="b22">Stowell (1996</link>), who draws a parallel between tenses in subordinate contexts and polarity items. In his view, the past tense is a past-polarity item, meaning that if in the scope of another past tense it behaves as <i>anybody</i> in the scope of negation; both do not contribute anything to the interpretation, so that it becomes possible to understand the illness in (32) as simultaneous to the saying. It should be noticed that the actual implementation of both proposals is somewhat underspecified. Abusch&apos;s theory of transmitted relation relies on a feature-passing mechanism that is not easy to accommodate within current generative grammar frameworks. Stowell&apos;s view, on the other hand, suffers the same shortcomings as any treatment of polarity &ndash; namely, what is the underlying syntactic mechanism? In this sense both are somewhat stipulative, as is <link rid="b29">Schlenker&apos;s (2003a</link>) recent proposal of agreement between semantic indices.</p>

<heading id="h6" level="2">3.3&ensp;The double access reading</heading>
<p>Together with some syntactic facts discussed in <link rid="b30">Giorgi and Pianesi (2000</link>), principle (37) provides an account of double access sentences (DAR) &ndash; e.g., (36). As first observed by <link rid="b31">Smith (1978</link>), such a sentence has the peculiarity that the pregnancy state referred to in the subordinate clause is simultaneous both to the saying and to the utterance. This doesn&apos;t mean that by using (36) a speaker commits herself to the truth of the complement &ndash; that is, to the existence of a pregnancy of Mary&apos;s holding at the speaker&apos;s time. Nor is there any commitment to the truth of the complement clause at Mary&apos;s, the subject&apos;s, time. Indeed, the speaker can continue her speech by uttering:</p>
<p>(40)&ensp;Actually, he was wrong. Mary has just been overeating for the last three months.</p>
<p>Scholars such as <link rid="b28">Abusch (1997</link>) and <link rid="b27">Ogihara (1995</link>) have argued in favor of a <i>de re</i> analysis of tenses in these cases, hypothesizing that the embedded present tense gets scoped out in (36), and that both the tense and its trace contribute to the interpretation. Scoping out is obligatory in present-under-past contexts, because the constraint on local and inherited relation for the present tense is that none of them be temporal precedence (<link rid="b28">Abusch 1997</link>), or because the present tense is an anti-past polarity item (<link rid="b22">Stowell 1996</link>).</p>
<p>Once scoped out, the behavior of the present tense is analyzed within a framework built upon <link rid="b32">Lewis&apos;s (1979</link>) suggestions, as further elaborated by <link rid="b33">Cresswell and Von Stechow (1982</link>). In this view, for a subject X to have a <i>de re</i> belief about an object Y is for X to ascribe Y a certain property Z. Property ascription, in turn, relies on subject X being suitably connected with object X by means of an appropriate acquaintance relation which makes the object (epistemically) available to the subject. Omitting details (which can be found in the works cited), the analysis of a DAR sentence such as (36) requires that:</p>

</p>
<p>In Abusch&apos;s account, the first point follows from the already-mentioned theory of transmitted relations in intensional contexts: the constraint on the local and the transmitted relations of a present tense, in fact, is that none of them be temporal precedence. Thus, in a present-under-past sentence the tense must be scoped out. Finally, Abusch argues that a suitable acquaintance relation for (36) is one picking out the maximal interval at which Mary has a big belly (the hypothesis is that the speaker is interested in explaining Mary&apos;s symptoms), and one which, for independent reasons, picks up an interval that in the actual world overlaps with both the saying and the utterance time.</p>
<p>As should be clear, the offered account of the DAR relies on hypotheses involving both the syntax and the semantics. Concerning the former, it is necessary that the <i>de re</i> tense be scoped out of the embedded clause at LF, hence that a position be made available for it to land in. At the same time, the trigger for such a movement, though spelled out in terms of the constraints on local and transmitted relations, is essentially syntactic: temporal relations are cumulated down the syntactic trees through a mechanism of feature passing, which is typically syntactic (this obviously holds in general of Abusch&apos;s proposal, hence also of the discussed account of the simultaneous reading of (32)). It is not clear whether and how the syntactic theory can bear the burden of these two requirements. Invisible movement have recently come under the scrutiny of syntacticians who seem more wary than in the past about these matters. Concerning the feature-passing mechanism, it is not something that current theories of generative grammar seem so able, or even willing, to accommodate. So the basic problem of how temporal dependencies should be handled remains open.</p>
<p>On the semantic side, the <i>de re</i> account has a number of empirical and conceptual shortcomings. Given the constraint on the acquaintance relation, it can explain why an utterance of (36) is odd if Mary&apos;s symptoms do not persist at speech time. However, it has difficulties in explaining why the same utterance is odd if the symptoms persist but the situation has changed in relevant respects. Suppose, for instance, that Mary was indeed pregnant when John said what he did, that she delivered just a few days before the report, and that, as often happen in these cases, she still has a big belly. If this is the situation, the DAR report is odd, and the oddness seems to have to do more with the speaker&apos;s knowledge/beliefs &ndash; that is, with her propositional attitudes &ndash; than with John&apos;s. Interestingly, the converse also holds. If Mary was not pregnant at the saying time (John was wrong), is now pregnant, and has a big belly all the time (for whatever reasons), then again (36) is odd. As before, what matters is that if the speaker knows that the situation has changed, she isn&apos;t in a position to use a DAR sentence. These facts are not easily captured by the <i>de re</i> accounts just reviewed.</p>
<p>Finally, on the conceptual side, <i>de re</i> accounts of DAR sentences place a heavy epistemological burden on the speaker&apos;s shoulders: she must have quite detailed intuitions about the subject&apos;s original situation (mental state, one could say). On the other hand, it seems that one can use a DAR sentence without any information about what moved John into saying what he did (the big belly?). Short of saying that the speaker can postulate non-specific acquaintance relations, it is not clear how the vast majority of uses of DAR sentences can be accounted for. But non-specific acquaintance relations don&apos;t seem to be what Lewis had in mind when he introduced acquaintance relations; he seemed to mean that they should be of a very specific type.</p>
<p>A different approach to DAR sentences, trying to address those concerns, was proposed by <link rid="b25">Giorgi and Pianesi (2001b</link>). They explicitly attempt to link the temporal interpretation with syntactic facts, while at the same time capitalizing on the idea that by using a DAR sentence the speaker expresses an attitude of hers. On the syntactic side, the basic observations concern the fact that in Italian, DAR contexts typically have the indicative mood, and reject complementizer deletion (see <link rid="b30 b24">Giorgi and Pianesi 2000, 2001a</link>):</p>

<p>On the other hand, contexts that allow complementizer deletion, such as those induced by verbs like <i>credere</i> (believe) or <i>temere</i> (fear), do not allow the DAR. Thus, some connection seems to be at stake between CD and DAR. Giorgi and Pianesi&apos;s explanation is cast in a split-C framework: two distinct complementizers can be singled out in embedded clauses; namely, a lower one, called MOOD, which is related to the presence of an embedded subjunctive verb, and a higher one, C. MOOD is just the lexicalization of the mood features, which can also be realized syncretically (<link rid="b17">Giorgi and Pianesi 1997</link>) in Infl. When the syncretic option is exerted, MOOD is absent, thence the appearance of complementizer deletion. On the other hand, C&apos;s features cannot be realized syncretically, hence C cannot be omitted. The relationship between the ban on CD and the possibility of the DAR, therefore, points to an important role to be played by C: the DAR obtains only if C is projected (irrespective of the specific tense chosen). To explain this relationship, Giorgi and Pianesi hypothesize that the complementizer C is endowed with temporal features (&tgr;-features) entering a relation with those of the embedded T, by either movement or matching. As a result, when the ILF for the embedded clause of (36) is computed and the interpretive contribution of tenses is spelled out, the same eventive variable is present in C and in T:</p>

<p>The C node is invariably associated with speaker orientation, so that the temporal features in C yield the &lsquo;normal&rsquo; indexical value. Moreover, (37) is strengthened into a bi-conditional, to the effect that whenever a representation contains the temporal coordinate of an agent then it must express the content of an attitude by that agent.</p>
<p>Concerning (46a), three ILFs must be considered. The first is built from C&apos;s complement, XP in (46a); it is interpreted under a subject-oriented assignment, and reports the content of the subject&apos;s original dictum. The result is that the in-situ copy of the present tense provides for a pregnancy that overlaps with the subject&apos;s temporal coordinate. Then we have the node C itself, where the &tgr;-features are interpreted by means of the speaker-oriented assignment. The result is that the pregnancy state overlaps with the speaker&apos;s temporal coordinates as well. Finally, we have the ILF associated with the whole dominating CP, where the former two ILFs are put together in such a way that they are required to have coordinated value: whenever the one (the ILF for XP) is true, the other (that for C) is true as well, and vice versa. This coordination of truth-values is meant to account for the observation made above about the content of the speaker&apos;s attitude: the speaker maintains that if Mary was pregnant at the subject&apos;s time then the same pregnancy obtains at her time, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The following features of this approach should be noticed: it generalizes the idea, already discussed in <link rid="ss6">section 3.2</link>, that the content of attitude ascriptions, as expressed by ILFs, depends on the subject&apos;s coordinate (context/mental state) since it incorporates her temporal coordinates, and explicitly extends it to the speaker, by seeing C as the locus where speaker orientation comes to play a role. This approach shares with <i>de re</i> theories the idea that the tense is moved. However, it identifies the place where movement is directed to, namely, C, and motivates such a movement with the triggering &tgr;-features in C.</p>

<p>If temporal entities (times) are part of the ontology underlying natural language, and reference to them proceeds the way it does with ordinary objects, we should be able to individuate the same range of referential phenomena observed with the latter. In particular, it should be possible to single out terms exhibiting direct reference to temporal entities, behaving as the counterparts of, say, a proper name such as <i>John</i>, or of a deictic/indexical term such as <i>here</i> or <i>that man</i>. It should also be possible to show that their semantic and syntactic properties are similar to those of &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; proper names or indexical/deictic terms.</p>
<p>Obvious candidates for direct reference in the temporal realm are the names of days and months used in isolation &ndash; e.g., <i>Thursday</i>, <i>Sunday</i>, and <i>May</i>. They can appear as expressions fixing the time of the event:</p>

<p>In all these cases, the reference of these expressions is indexical, crucially involving the use of the speaker&apos;s temporal coordinate.

In this sense, they constitute canonical examples of direct reference.

<p>This position can be occupied by an overt determiner (cf. (49a)), by the raised nominal head, as in (49c), or by an empty determiner, as in (49e), where a mass noun appears. Longobardi explains this pattern, and, in particular, the fact that proper nouns occupy the D<sup>0</sup> position in syntax, by assuming that the functional category D has a feature &lsqb;&plusmn; <i>ref</i>&rsqb; that must be checked by a corresponding feature on the noun. The feature <i>ref</i> is strong in Romance and weak in Germanic, and this explains the contrast between (49c) and (49d) on the one hand and (49a) and (49b) on the other:</p>

</p>
<p>Moreover, <i>ref</i> is connected to the referential properties of the whole DP. A proper name such as <i>John</i> has <i>ref</i>, because it refers directly to the relevant person. Given that <i>ref</i> is strong in Romance, Italian proper names must overtly rise to D<sup>0</sup> from their base position (cf. (49c)), preventing adjectives from preceding proper nouns (cf. (49d)). On the other hand, the weak <i>ref</i> of Germanic allows English proper nouns to rise covertly, thus permitting the pronominal adjective of (50a). Finally, common nouns, such as <i>madre</i> (mother) in (49a) and (49b), are not object referring, and as such cannot be endowed with the <i>ref</i> feature. As a consequence, the overt article is needed.</p>

<p>These examples reproduce the pattern in (49) and can be taken as evidence that the noun <i>gioved&igrave;</i> (Thursday) can overtly raise to D<sup>0</sup>, as proper names do in Longobardi&apos;s theory, and for similar reasons. Thus, in (49c) and (51a), with the postnominal adjective, the definite article may be dropped, showing that the noun has risen in the D<sup>0</sup> position. When the adjective is prenominal, however, the article must be present, as in (49d) and (51b). Finally, (54a) and (54b) reproduce the same pattern with a non-temporal adjective, <i>solo</i> (only).</p>
<p>This behavior isn&apos;t reproduced with an adjective such as <i>precedente</i> (previous/before), as the contrast between (51&ndash;52) and (55) exemplifies:</p>

<p>With a restrictive interpretation of the adjective <i>alto</i> (tall), (56a) is marginal, whereas an appositive reading is completely unavailable. The sentence improves with an article, as in (56b). If this reasoning is on the right track, one may extend it to the sentences in (55), observing that they contain restrictive phrases that are obligatorily postnominal.</p>
<p>Proper nouns yield better results with postnominal restrictive adjectives, such as <i>bello</i> (handsome), than with postnominal (restrictive) adverbials, such as <i>prima</i> (before):</p>

<p>The quasi-acceptability of (57) contrasts with the strong unacceptability of (58b).</p>
<p>This evidence seems to stress the role of modifiers in endowing the nominal head with object referring capabilities. E.g., adjectives such as <i>scorso</i> (last) in (51&ndash;52), being indexical, provide the nominal head with directly referential capabilities &ndash; that is, they provide &lsqb;&plus; <i>ref</i>&rsqb; &ndash; so that it can raise overtly to the D<sup>0</sup> position in Italian. An adjective such as <i>precedente</i> (previous/before) does not have this possibility, so that the nominal head cannot raise to D<sup>0</sup>.</p>
<p>This discussion shows that direct reference (in the form of indexical reference) can be found in the temporal realm. Importantly, the expressions realizing it participate in the same syntactic pattern as those observed for objectual reference.</p>
<p>When the relevant expressions are used to temporally locate the event, the same pattern presented in (51&ndash;54) is reproduced:</p>

<p>The article can be dropped in (59a) and (59c), where the adjective is in the prenominal position, showing that the nominal head has raised in (59a) and (59c). The article cannot be omitted in (59b), as the order <i>adjective-noun</i> shows, since the nominal head has not risen. Furthermore, these observations can be reproduced when the adverbial is in sentence-initial position (cf. (59a) and (59c)). Finally, (61) shows that, as in (54), the relevant behavior can be obtained not only with temporal adjectives such as <i>scorso</i> (last) but also with others, such as <i>solo</i> (only).</p>
<p>The data in (59) to (61) confirm the conclusion drawn above, and constitute evidence in favor of the hypothesis that temporal adverbs have argument status. In particular, (59b), (60b), and (61b) show that these phrases require a filled D<sup>0</sup>, a behavior which is typical of arguments. Hence, temporal expressions fixing the time of the event seem to be the lowest arguments in the VP shell (cf. <link rid="b35">Larson 1988b</link>). To support this conclusion, note that the constraints seen above do not arise in non-argument position &ndash; that is, in predicative contexts:</p>

<p>In argument position, the lack of the determiner is due to the overt raising of the nominal head to D<sup>0</sup>. Therefore, adjectives such as <i>scorso</i> (last) and <i>solo</i> (only) cannot appear in prenominal position (cf. (59b) and (61b)). On the other hand, predicative positions do not require DPs, and bare NPs are allowed. Hence, prenominal adjectives are possible without a determiner:</p>

<p>Example (64), where <i>venerd&igrave; prima</i> &lsquo;Friday before&rsquo; is an NP, contrasts with (55).</p>
<p>In conclusion, it can be shown in a non-trivial way not only that direct reference is available in the temporal realm, as expected if temporal reference is available to natural language, but also that the syntax of direct reference for temporal phrases is, in relevant respects, similar to that of direct reference to ordinary objects. Finally, these conclusions hold both for temporal expressions in subject and object positions, and for those fixing the time of the event, showing that the latter deserve to be treated as arguments rather than as modifiers.</p>

<heading id="h8" level="1">4&ensp;A non-referential approach</heading>
<p>After this cursory review of the merits of the referential approach &ndash; namely, the idea that the interpretive properties of tenses and temporal expression are best explained by having variables in the object language that refer to temporal entities &ndash; it might seem strange to consider theories claiming that temporal entities and temporal reference should be banned from the basic ontology and from semantics. Yet this has been an influential view, especially in philosophy, and it has recently found more than episodic links with linguistics, thanks to <link rid="b1">Ludlow (1999</link>). The importance of this enterprise to linguistics is that it tries to show that the very basic question of whether reference to time is to be admitted or not among the tools of the theory is still an open issue, and that it must be solved both by taking seriously metaphysical concerns, and by comparing alternative theories on an empirical basis.</p>
<p>In this section we will present the basic tenets of Ludlow&apos;s theory, trying first to provide reasons for the move, and to discuss the theory&apos;s machinery and some of its applications to selected phenomena, often the same as those addressed in our review of referential approaches. Given that Ludlow is our sole source, we will try to be as faithful as possible to his exposition. Occasionally, however, we will integrate the analyses, paying attention to keeping to Ludlow&apos;s original intuitions.</p>
<subsection id="ss10" level="2">
<heading id="h9" level="2">4.1&ensp;A-series vs. B-series</heading>
<p>Metaphysical concerns are crucial for anyone thinking that the goal of semantic theory is to investigate the &lsquo;tacit&rsquo; knowledge that permits people to draw appropriate language&ndash;world connections. Such a theory is, for instance, an absolute truth theory of semantic knowledge of the kind we have been often resorting to in this chapter &ndash; namely, an axiomatic theory comprising axioms giving the referents of terminal symbols, and rules for producing the semantic value of non-terminal nodes starting from the former values. For the theory to make interesting claims, it must rely on some understanding of what is out there in the world, hence it cannot escape some amount of metaphysical commitment. By the same token, Ludlow argues that linguistic inquiry can in turn contribute to further investigation on metaphysical issues.</p>
<p>As far as time is concerned, two metaphysical positions have stimulated the ingenuity of scholars. According to the first (Russell, Reichenbach, Einstein, etc.), time is a sequence of unchanging tenseless events, whereby &ldquo;future events, past events, and present events are all equally real&rdquo; (<link rid="b1">Ludlow 1999</link>: 1). This view is known as the <i>B-series</i> theory of time (<link rid="b36">McTaggart 1908</link>), or the untensed conception (<link rid="b37">Mellor 1981</link>), and is the one underlying referential approaches to time in language. It is opposed by the <i>A-series</i> or <i>tensed</i> doctrine, which retorts that &ldquo;it is fundamental to the notion of time that events, or perhaps propositions, have genuine temporal status&rdquo; (<link rid="b1">Ludlow 1999</link>: 2). As a consequence, the metaphysical status of past and future events might be different, corresponding to different properties.</p>
<p>The B-series conception maintains that the basic relations are the familiar ones which can be construed from the notion of <i>precedence</i>, and allow us to talk about an event/time as being <i>earlier-than</i>, <i>later-than</i>, or <i>simultaneous-with</i>, another event/time. These notions suffice to analyze and explain away change, which is taken not to be metaphysically real, but to have only a psychological status. In other words, change is apparent: events/times are given, and all we can say is that some of them precede and/or are simultaneous with some others. We do have the &lsquo;feeling&rsquo; of change, but, as observed, this is not metaphysically real and has no direct counterpart in the underlying ontology; in this sense, the B-series is objective.</p>
<p>The alternative account replies that change <i>is</i> metaphysically real: a past event is ontologically different from a future event, and this requires that the relation of precedence be abandoned in favor of the basic notions of <i>past</i>, <i>present</i>, and <i>future</i> (thus avoiding constructing the latter from the former). The consequence is that time entities with their usual ordering are not part of the underlying ontology, and the whole repertory of referential semantics, with its resources (direct reference, quantification, the traditional views about indexicality) cannot be used to account for temporal talk. For the same reasons, the A-series view is not friendly to traditional tense logics. As observed in <link rid="ss4">section 3</link>, though the latter eschew explicit talk about temporal entities from the object language, they have it in the metalanguage. The A-series conception opposes this move too; there are no time points (or intervals) in the ontology, so they cannot be manipulated at any level of the logical language.</p>
<p>The two opposing fields have both metaphysical and semantic facts to duel about. We won&apos;t insist on the former, for which we refer the reader to <link rid="b1">Ludlow (1999</link>) and to <link rid="b38">Bonomi (2002</link>). Concerning the latter, a case in point is constituted by temporal indexicals. Ludlow considers the situation of a person (himself, apparently) who thinks:</p>
<p>(65)&ensp;My fifth anniversary is March 12.</p>
<p>Upon discovering that the very day of that thought <i>is</i> March 12, he shouts:</p>
<p>(66)&ensp;My fifth anniversary is today!</p>
<p>These two tokens exemplify one of the classic problems of indexicals. If we take a referential view of times, and hypothesize that the meaning of an utterance is a tenseless (impersonal) proposition, then the two utterances above may end up having the same meaning &ndash; namely, the proposition that Ludlow&apos;s anniversary is March 12. But clearly, there&apos;s a difference between the kind of knowledge communicated by (65) and that pertaining to (66). Even if we admit that the two utterances have the same content/meaning &ndash; e.g., that a particular event (Ludlow&apos;s anniversary) occurs at a particular time &ndash; we need to account for the cognitive difference. The latter seems to consist of the fact that by uttering (66), the speaker acknowledges that March 12 (the day of his anniversary) is the same day as that of his utterance. The particular mood he is in is caused by this very fact, not by the (much less urgent) piece of information that his anniversary occurs at such-and-such a time. A possible move suggested in the literature (<link rid="b39 b40">Perry 1969, 1977</link>; <link rid="b41">Kaplan 1990</link>; etc.) consists in capturing the difference by means of the notion of the character/role of an (indexical) expression. Characters are entities which connect meanings to contexts of speech/thoughts in such a way that, given a context, the character of an indexical expression provides its meaning. In the case at hand, <i>March 12</i> and <i>today</i> are indexical expressions (the former is taken to refer to the next such day), and have different characters. The meanings (the time individuals) they provide are what enter the truth-conditions of the two utterances. <link rid="b9">Larson and Segal (1995</link>) suggest executing this in the following way:</p>

<p>It should be noted that, in a sense, characters remain outside semantics; actually, they play a role in determining truth-conditions, but they do so only by delivering meanings, used to compute truth-conditions. This state of affairs has the consequence that even the differences between (65) and (66) remain beyond the reach of semantics. Indeed, the time of utterance happens to be March 12 for both sentences, hence the truth-conditions in (68) end up being the same. So, while the notion of character has some role in accounting for the different status of (65) as compared to (66), this remains outside the semantic realm.</p>
<p>For those who are dissatisfied with this outcome, believing that the difference between (65) and (66) should be reflected in the semantics/truth-conditions, the possibility is open of resorting to <i>token-reflexive</i> truth-conditions &agrave; la <link rid="b10">Reichenbach (1947</link>), which incorporate the reference to the very utterance (thought) token in the truth-conditions. In this case, the truth-conditions for (65) and (66) are as follows:</p>

</p>
<p>Now, the right-hand sides of the truth-conditions differ, for the second explicitly mentions the utterance token when spelling out the referent of the indexical, whereas the other doesn&apos;t. So it seems that we have both captured the different cognitive significance of our two utterances, and managed to keep the distinction within semantics.</p>
<p>Successful as it may appear, however, the token-reflexive strategy has its own problems. In the first place, it is not clear how the required reference to the utterance can be introduced in the semantic machinery, a seemingly technical problem that we won&apos;t discuss here. Second, a case can be construed that causes the collapse (in Ludlow&apos;s view) of the token-reflexive strategy. The point to be made draws on observations made by <link rid="b42">Casta&ntilde;eda (1967</link>) about token-reflexivity applied to the first person. In the case of temporality, it turns on the truth-conditions of utterances of (70a), which are as in (70b) according to the token-reflexive strategy:</p>

</p>
<p>The problem is that though utterances of (70a) are false, they are contingently so (it might have been the case that nobody uttered anything); (70b), however, is necessarily false, because of the presence of the reference to the utterance token in the truth-conditions. If we drop such a reference, however, we give up the prospect of bringing context/character within the semantics. Ludlow&apos;s conclusion is that the tension between a satisfactory account of temporal indexicality and the analysis of sentences that are about linguistic tokens, such as (70a), originates from the very resources of the B-series &ndash; namely, times and reference thereto. So attempts at getting rid of the B-series seem justified.</p>
<p>Are there any reasons, on the other hand, to prefer the B-series to the A-series? Of course there are, and we have already presented some of them when we discussed the shortcomings of temporal logics: complex tenses and anaphora are the best-known and most discussed problems, not only for temporal logics, but for any genuine A-series accounts. Given that the latter do not even admit temporal entities in the ontology, how can temporal anaphora be dealt with? And how can complex tenses be accounted for?</p>
<p>The only effective reply is to try and develop an explicit A-theory semantics. In this respect, we saw that the tensed approach takes change as real and as having a privileged status. How can such a primacy be captured? What does it mean that all we need are the notions of past, present, and future? Moreover, change must be accounted for in a non-circular way; it wouldn&apos;t help to resort to the metaphor of passing/flowing time, because such a passage or flow already takes place in time. The only solution seems to be that being past, present, or future be seen as properties that propositions (or proposition-like objects) have or fail to have, and that change is simply the fact that a certain proposition <i>was</i> future, <i>is</i> present, and <i>will be</i> past. This, according to Ludlow, was <link rid="b2">Prior&apos;s (1967</link>) position, often confused with the idea that there was <i>a time</i> at which a certain proposition was future, there is <i>a time</i> at which it is present, and there will be <i>a time</i> at which it will be past. The latter is what lies behind the attempts at capturing Prior&apos;s intuitions in tense logics, but those statements obviously fail to do justice to the untensed view of the A-series, for they admit temporal entities, and admit reference to them, even if only at the metalanguage level. Taking Prior&apos;s idea seriously amounts, therefore, to requiring that <i>Past</i> be &ldquo;an indexical predicate that holds of a proposition-like object, effectively displaying the indexical sense of a past-tense morpheme&rdquo; (<link rid="b1">Ludlow 1999</link>: 97).</p>

<p>The first axiom assigns the value <i>true</i> to the clausal structure &lsqb;<sub>XP</sub> T YP&rsqb; iff the ILF of YP (a proposition-like object) is the value associated with the tense node. As with tense logical approaches, this treatment relies on the idea that there is an appropriate representation in which the tense morpheme takes clausal scope. The contribution of the tense morpheme, in turn, is ruled by (71b&ndash;d), which implement the idea that tenses behave as indexical predicates of proposition-like objects. Once, e.g., (71a) and (71b) are put together, we can derive the following theorem for an utterance of <i>John left</i>:</p>
<p>(72)&ensp;Val(true, &lsqb;<sub>XP</sub> Tpast &lsqb;<sub>IP</sub> John leave&rsqb;&rsqb;, &sigma;) iff <sub>&sigma;</sub>&lsqb;&rsqb;IP&lsqb;&rsqb; was true.</p>
<p>That is, that utterance is true iff the ILF of the IP phrase was true. To take another (well-known) example, consider utterances of the sentence <i>My root canal is over</i> used to express relief after a dreadful session at the dentist (similar examples are discussed by <link rid="b2 b23">Prior 1967, Higginbotham 1995</link>, and others). The present theory assigns it the truth-conditions in (73a), whereas the Larson-and-Segal-style B-series theory would yield (73b):</p>

<p>As argued by many, (73b) does not explain why one can express relief by uttering that sentence: what is there to be relieved about in the fact that an event precedes a certain time (or another event)? Arguably, (73a) fares better: the sense of relief stems from the fact that a given proposition (the ILF in (73a)) is past for the speaker.</p>
<p>Following the same path, it is possible to define axioms for other indexicals, such as <i>yesterday</i> or <i>tomorrow</i>, by treating them in the same disquotational manner as <i>past</i>, <i>present</i>, and <i>future</i> in (71):</p>

<heading id="h10" level="2">4.2&ensp;Complex tenses</heading>
<p>An important development of the theory concerns complex tenses. The account has similarities with the revised Reichenbachian analysis of <link rid="b17">Giorgi and Pianesi (1997</link>) and others discussed in <link rid="ss5">section 3.1</link>, since it takes complex tenses to involve multi-clausal constructions. Giorgi and Pianesi exploit two tense categories (T1, which is responsible for the relationship between the event time and the reference time, and T2, which attends to the relationship between the reference time and speech time), and hypothesize that the clause hosting T2 is a complement of that where T1 lies, both being always explicit. Ludlow, on the other hand, provides LF representations for complex tenses based on matrix-adjunct structures, where the adjunct is a <i>when</i>-, <i>before</i>-, or <i>after</i>-clause that might remain implicit. Again, the axioms for the connectives rely on a disquotational treatment:</p>

<p>After this, it is hypothesized that all natural languages have (implicit) <i>when</i>-clauses, whose structure is the same as that of explicit ones, and whose tense is in concord with that of the main clause.</p>
<p>With this in place, the syntactic structure for a pluperfect such as (75a) is as in (75b), where the past tense prefixed to the <i>before</i>-clause results from the requirement that the tenses of the main and adjunct clauses match:</p>

<p>Attempting a Reichenbachian analogy, the matrix clause of (76b) expresses the relationship between the event time and the speech time; the adjunct relates the reference time to the speech time, and the connectives <i>when</i>, <i>before</i>, and <i>after</i> take care of linking the event and the reference times. This differs in important respects from the neo-Reichenbachian analyses: the latter, in fact, link the reference time both to the event time and to the speech time, sometimes encoding such a dependency, as in <link rid="b17">Giorgi and Pianesi (1997</link>) in the morphosyntax of tenses.</p>

<p>To repeat, tenses introduce indexical predicates that are treated disquotationally: what a past tense contributes is that the ILF corresponding to the de-tensed clause was true. There is no mention of times, as we would have in temporal logics (the proposition was true at a past time &equals; the (de-tensed) proposition is true at a past time). Complex tenses require implicit <i>when</i>-, <i>before</i>-, or <i>after</i>-clauses, with temporal connectives also treated disquotationally.</p>
<p>Ludlow argues that thanks to this machinery, the theory avoids one of the commonest charges against temporal logics &ndash; namely, the unconstrained nature of the account of complex tenses (see <link rid="ss3">section 2</link>). Contrary to the case of temporal logics, the problem does not arise here, since complex tenses correspond not to the nesting operators, but to implicit clauses introduced by appropriate temporal connectives. Operator composition is not required, hence unwanted combinations are expected not to arise. As <link rid="b1">Ludlow (1999</link>: 124) puts it: &ldquo;The system merely recapitulates the structure made available by the system of explicit temporal conjunctions, and inherits the constraints on that system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture, one might object that the possibility of predicting non-existing tenses might not be completely ruled out, since temporal clauses can be nested:</p>
<p>(78)&ensp;John left when you started to address Mary after she provoked Henry.</p>
<p>To the extent that the syntax of implicit <i>when</i>-clauses parallels that of explicit ones, nesting temporal clauses cannot be dismissed; hence the danger of overgenerating complex tenses isn&apos;t completely avoided.</p>
<p>As observed, the implicit temporal clauses can play the role of the Reichenbachian reference time. The latter, in turn, is a device for picking up contextually relevant times. Thus, for an utterance of <i>John had (already) left</i> to be felicitous, a contextually relevant time seems necessary, which plays the role of the reference time, as in the following discourse:</p>
<p>(79)&ensp;Mary entered. John had (already) left.</p>
<p>This is a case of temporal anaphora, and in general the reference time has anaphoric properties.</p>
<p>As we know, A-series theories ban temporal reference: there are no singular propositions about times, but only general ones, in the sense that none depends upon a particular temporal entity. So Ludlow accounts for the anaphoric properties of Reichenbach&apos;s reference time by deploying an E-type theory of temporal anaphora. Accordingly, (possibly implicit) temporal anaphors stand proxy for <i>when</i>-clauses, which provide the required descriptive content (for the notion of E-type anaphora, see <link rid="b43">Evans 1977</link>). Thus, in the discourse above, the second sentence would have the LF:</p>
<p>(80)&ensp;&lsqb;&lsqb;Tpast &lsqb;John leave&rsqb;&rsqb; before TPast &lsqb; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;&rsqb;</p>
<p>The content provided by the <i>before</i>-clause, in the case at hand, is something like <i>Mary entered</i>. Hence, the resulting truth-conditions are:</p>
<p>(81)&ensp;Val(true, &lsqb;&lsqb;Tpast &lsqb;John leave&rsqb;&rsqb; before Tpast&lsqb; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;&rsqb;, &sigma;) iff Val(true, &lsqb;Tpast &lsqb;John leave&rsqb;&rsqb;, &sigma;) before Val(true, Tpast&lsqb; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;, &sigma;).</p>
<p>Eventually, the second sentence of our small discourse is uttered truthfully iff <i>it was true that John left and this was before it was true that Mary entered</i>. Such a strategy, it is suggested, can be generalized to all cases of temporal anaphora. If workable, it would prove that A-series approaches can handle temporal anaphora, thus replying to an important objection made by its opponents.</p>

</p>
<p>In this case, the truth-conditions are that &lsquo;John will leave when the calendar says <i>July 13</i>, <i>2005</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This treatment can be extended to temporal expressions that exhibit contextual variability, such as <i>July 13</i>, or <i>Thursday</i>. In many cases they behave as indexicals, requiring additional information of linguistic provenance to define their interpretive contribution. Thus, according to whether the main tense is past or future, <i>Thursday</i> may mean either the last such day before the utterance, or the next one. In other words, they do not seem to be intrinsically tensed, but import the relevant information from other phrases. Hence, they are different from, and not amenable to the same treatment as, <i>yesterday</i> and <i>tomorrow</i>. In the present framework, one could attempt the following strategy. Let us consider <i>next Thursday</i>, and hypothesize that <i>next</i> is an indexical predicate true of proposition-like objects:</p>
<p>(84)&ensp;Val(x, next, &sigma;) iff x next true.</p>
<p>The axiom for <i>next</i> is similar to that of a tense, treating it disquotationally. We can pursue the parallelism further, and suggest that, within an implicit <i>when</i>-clause, <i>next</i> can play the role of a tense; more precisely, of a future tense. Thence, it will be available when the matrix tense is a future, and it will be ruled out in the presence of a past tense. From what we already know, we can now derive:</p>
<p>(85)&ensp;Val(true, &lsqb; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;next Thursday&rsqb;, &sigma;) iff <sub>&sigma;</sub>&lsqb;&rsqb;&lsqb; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Thursday .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;&lsqb;&rsqb; next true.</p>
<p>That is, <i>next Thursday</i> is true iff <i>the clock says Thursday</i> will (next) be true. For a sentence such as <i>John will leave next Thursday</i> we have:</p>
<p>(86)&ensp;Val(true, &lsqb;John will leave next Thursday&rsqb;, &sigma;) iff Val(true, &lsqb;John will leave&rsqb;, &sigma;) when Val(true, &lsqb;next Thursday&rsqb;, &sigma;).</p>
<p>With this, utterances of <i>John will leave next Thursday</i> are true iff <i>John leave</i> will be true when <i>next Thursday</i> will be true, i.e., when <i>the clock says Thursday</i> will (next) be true.</p>
<p>The case of bare temporal expressions, as in <i>John will leave (on) Thursday</i>, now follows. We need only recall that the tense (or the category playing the role of tense in the relevant phrase) must agree with that of the matrix. Because of this, the future-like <i>next</i> will be selected, giving:</p>
<p>(87)&ensp;Val(true, &lsqb;John will leave Thursday&rsqb;, &sigma;) iff Val(true, &lsqb;John will leave&rsqb;, &sigma;) when Val (true, &lsqb;<i>next</i> Thursday&rsqb;, &sigma;).</p>
<p>We have written &lsquo;next&rsquo; in italics to indicate that in this case it is not explicit, but stems from the general requirement ruling tense compatibility between matrix clauses and <i>when</i>-clauses.</p>
<p>As can be seen, the sketched analyses do not exploit times: there is no resort to entities such as the day <i>July 13</i> or the hour <i>five o&rsquo;clock</i>. What you have are measure systems that provide tags related to particular events: striking five vs. saying July 13. And the very event of measuring, of course, is tensed; thus, it occurred, occurs, or will occur.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the discussion is very cursory, but it reflects the status of the theory as developed by <link rid="b1">Ludlow (1999</link>). It should also be observed that it is not clear how explicit talk about time entities and about what in a B-series approach appear as ordinal/metrical/topological properties can be accounted for. Thus, what should be done with <i>the third Thursday</i>, or with <i>in two hours</i>, <i>for two months</i>, etc? (This also relates to a conceptual problem we overlooked with the proposed treatment for <i>next</i>, for the idea of something being &lsquo;next true&rsquo; seems to incorporate an ordinal notion of truth.)</p>
<p>Another important issue involves adverbs (and other devices) that have been argued by B-series theorists to be quantified over times/events:</p>

<p>The strategy suggested by Ludlow involves substitutional (rather than objectual) quantification over <i>when</i>-clauses. More precisely, times are reintroduced as second-order entities built out of <i>when</i>-clauses, in such a way that for a given sentence S and a given context of utterance c, a &lsquo;derived&rsquo; time, is the set of clauses S&prime; that are true when S is true. For instance, if S is &lsquo;John sang&rsquo; and we know that at that time Mary danced, his brother slept, etc., then the contextually determined &lsquo;time&rsquo; of S is t&equals;&lcub;&lsquo;Mary danced&rsquo;, &lsquo;his brother slept&rsquo;, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rcub;. With this, the truth-conditions for (88a) and (89a) are:</p>

</p>
<p>This seems to solve the problem of temporal quantification in an A-series framework: what you quantify over in sentences such as (89a) are not times/events, but descriptions of events. These are context-dependent, as they should be, and as they are acknowledged by any objectual quantification account (in that case, the issue is how to restrict quantifications to contextually relevant times/events/situations).</p>
<p>One possible problem concerns the extension of this strategy to sentences such as (91):</p>
<p>(91)&ensp;When I got to London I always met Mary.</p>
<p>Are they to be accounted for along the lines of (92)?</p>
<p>(92)&ensp;For every S&equals;&lsqb;I got to London&rsqb;, &lsquo;I met Mary when &ldquo;S&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; is true.</p>
<p>If so, the role of quantification actually is in danger of being emptied. For there is only one sentence &ndash; namely, <i>I got to London</i> &ndash; in question, so that you evaluate the right-hand side of (92) only once, obtaining the sentence <i>I met Mary when I got to London</i>. This, in turn, is true iff <i>it was true that I met Mary when it was true that I got to London</i>. Eventually, we have semel-factive truth-conditions. The speaker of (91), however, intends the <i>when</i>-clause to describe many events of going to London, but then it seems that we cannot use the same sentence for picking them up. In the end, if (92) is not the right way to address sentences such as (91), what should we do with it?</p>
<p>Beside this observation, some questions come naturally to mind. For instance, could one try to mimic the B-series on a contextual basis (e.g., by reintroducing a <i>later-than</i> relation on derived times, building on the connective <i>before</i>), thus recovering part of its expressiveness, and address, e.g., the problems we saw above with temporal locating phrases? and if derived time entities are needed because of quantification and/or because we can talk about their ordinal/metrical/topological properties, then doesn&apos;t this implicitly speak in favor of B-series approaches?</p>

<p>The implicit <i>when</i>-clause could be taken to E-type-refer to the time of the matrix event &ndash; that is, it could be something like <i>&lsqb;when &lsqb;John did the saying&rsqb;&rsqb;</i> &ndash; or, as Ludlow suggests, it can be an E-type anaphora to some other contextually relevant clause, e.g., &lsquo;when John went home&rsquo;. The first option could then be used to account for the simultaneous reading of (90), whereas the latter might provide for the shifted reading. Such a suggestion incorporates the independent view of tenses (<link rid="b44">Dowty 1982b</link>; <link rid="b28">Abusch 1997</link>), according to which tenses in matrix clauses behave the same way as in matrices. However, it is inadequate, for the reasons discussed in <link rid="ss6">section 3.2</link>: not all past sentences will do, but only those that are not future with respect to the subject (John). So, to adopt a referential jargon, (93a) cannot be a true report of a speech of John&apos;s where he says &lsquo;Mary will be ill in two days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When dealing with B-series theories, it was argued that these and other cases point to the necessity of representing the subject&apos;s (&equals; the attitude&apos;s agent) coordinate in the ILF of the subordinate clause. In essence, it was said that temporal indexicality, at least as far as tenses are concerned, must be relativized to subjects. The proposal was implemented by distinguishing assignment sequences for the speaker from those for the subject, and have the latter used for the ILF of the complement clause of propositional attitude predicates.</p>
<p>In the present framework, and with the present implementation of the A-series view, one might wonder whether this process of relativizing indexicals to subjects&rsquo; contexts is still available. Tenses, in fact, are treated disquotationally, and their indexicality is not articulated anywhere, but directly used. Thus, in the axiom below, it is the metalanguage <i>was</i> on the right-hand side that bears the burden of indexicality, being naturally interpreted as the user&apos;s (speaker&apos;s):</p>
<p>(94)&ensp;Val(x, Past, &sigma;) iff x was true.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the cases we are interested in &ndash; say, the shifted reading of (93a) &ndash; we would like to say that both the <i>was</i> of the embedded clause and the tense of the implicit <i>when</i>-clause (or, if you prefer, the relevant perspective) are John&apos;s (the subject&apos;s). In the case of the simultaneous reading (and pending an explanation of SOT), the embedded tense expresses a present tense from John&apos;s perspective, etc. Given that, as observed, the indexicality of tenses is not articulated anywhere, it seems that the only possibility of the A-series approach capturing those intuitions consists in changing the way evaluation is accomplished. For instance, we could propose that the LFs of the embedded clauses of attitude reports are (or can be) evaluated by using a simulation strategy. In order to compute the correct ILF (or whatever it is that represents the content of the reported attitude), people project themselves onto, and adopt, the subject&apos;s egocentric perspective. Thus, when interpreting an utterance of (93a), the speaker/hearer continues to use axiom (94), however she does so, as if she were the subject, thus turning the tense into that of the (simulated) subject. This line of thought can be extended to DAR sentences (see <link rid="ss7">section 3.3</link>). If we agree that movement of the embedded tense to the higher C creates two copies of the temporal features, then we can retain the idea that the first, in-situ copy is evaluated in a simulative mode (as if it were the subject&apos;s), and that the other copy is evaluated in the ordinary mode (as being the speaker&apos;s). (Perhaps Ludlow could subscribe to the simulation strategy applied to tenses in subordinate context. He explicitly mentions it as a possibility for indexicals in general, 1999: 64.)</p>
</subsection>
<subsection id="ss14" level="2">
<heading id="h13" level="2">4.5&ensp;Taking stock of the A-series approach</heading>
<p>Our survey of the A-series, tensed theory has been very cursory, both for reasons of space, and because the reference work (<link rid="b1">Ludlow 1999</link>) is itself often cursory. Both in Ludlow&apos;s case and in ours, the goal was to show that the approach deserves to be pursued, that it can be motivated on both linguistic and non-linguistic grounds, and that, in the end, it can be compared to competing approaches by resorting to the usual notions and tools of descriptive and explanatory adequacy. Some critical observations, beyond those already provided during the discussion, can be made, though.</p>
<p>An important point concerns the burden Ludlow&apos;s program places on syntax. This is a heavy one and requires more investigation before the empirical and theoretical consequences of the theory can be properly assessed. For instance, the extensive use of implicit <i>when</i>-/<i>before</i>-/<i>after</i>-clauses requires that their status be better investigated and clarified. As it turns out from our survey, these clauses can be completely implicit, as in the case of complex tenses, or part of their content may be visible, as with locating temporal adverbial. As to partially explicit <i>when</i>-clauses, one could think about adapting and extending the analysis Den <link rid="b45">Dikken et al. (1996</link>) have proposed for intensional verbs such as <i>seek</i>, which they suggest also take (partially) implicit complement clauses. Borrowing ideas developed in that work, one might hypothesize that partially implicit <i>when</i>-clauses for temporal adverbials have a null verb with an underspecified semantic, so that the resulting structure would be (95), with the subject also being implicit:</p>
<p>(95)&ensp;&lsqb;Subj &lsqb;<sub>VP</sub> V &lsqb;three o&rsquo;clock&rsqb;&rsqb;&rsqb;</p>
<p>One could then go on by suggesting that Subj be spelled out as some measure system (the calendar, the clock, etc.), and that the implicit verb be given the following lexical axiom:</p>
<p>(96)&ensp;Val(&lt;x, y, e&gt;, VERB, &sigma;) iff e is an event of time measurement, x is the measuring tool/system, and y is the measure.</p>
<p>Again, this is just a possible way to proceed, and more work is needed to establish this on firmer grounds. Also, the status of temporal phrases as PPs or DPs should be considered. Perhaps expressions consisting of DPs could be integrated into the present view along the lines suggested above, as arguments of implicit verbs of implicit clauses. The move is not so straightforward for PPs, for the same (implicit) verb should select either them or DPs.</p>
<p>More serious difficulties are raised by temporal phrases in subject or direct object position:</p>

<p>Though perhaps workable for (97a), the strategy seems more difficult with (97b). For what would <i>beautiful</i> be predicated of? Should we resort to months, hence times, as second-order/derived entities? And given that the latter are sets of propositions, does it make any sense to say that <i>beautiful</i> is predicated of (sets of) them? The problem is even more acute in light of an example discussed by <link rid="b38">Bonomi (2002</link>):</p>
<p>(99)&ensp;Last Monday will be described by the newspapers as &lsquo;Black Monday&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It seems impossible, here, to resort to the <i>when</i>-clause strategy, for what paraphrase based on it could do the work? And, even if this were possible, attention should be paid to ensuring that whatever at LF corresponds to <i>last Monday</i> be not in the scope of the future tense &ndash; a problem which, as might be noted, is reminiscent of similar difficulties temporal logic approaches had in dealing with the scope interactions between the tense operator and those of noun phrases (see <link rid="ss3">section 2</link>).</p>
<p>In the end, even if the <i>when</i>-clause strategy can be made to work properly for locating temporal phrases, it is hard to see what the treatment of the same expressions could be like when they appear as subjects or objects. From the point of view of linguistic theory, referential approaches have an obvious advantage over non-referential ones here: whereas the former can treat temporal phrases uniformly, irrespective of whether they serve to locate the event or function as subjects/objects, the tensed approach might end up needing to maintain an asymmetry between the two.</p>
<p>Turning to fully implicit clauses, they are crucial for E-type temporal anaphora. The choice here is between truly implicit (non-visible, but syntactically active) clauses, or null pronouns that, in virtue of the E-type analysis, yield clausal-like contributions to the truth-conditions. Ludlow explicitly considers the first alternative, speaking of LF representations at which implicit clauses are available. An important point, in this respect, is how those LF representations are built from available material in the case of complex tenses:</p>

<p>According to the examples given, the main clauses contain the verb, and are prefixed by a tense that seems to be the one originally appearing on the auxiliary. So in <i>John had left</i>, the verb appears in the main clause, and the latter is prefixed by the past tense of the auxiliary: <i>&lsqb;<sub>S</sub> Past &lsqb;<sub>S</sub> John aux leave&rsqb; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;</i>. This configuration can be obtained by letting the tense (covertly) take wide scope, and the auxiliary be interpretively inert. The participle marking on the verb, in turn, seems to play a role in determining the type of connective to be used: <i>before</i> in the case of the pluperfect tense and of the future perfect tense. Maybe this is due to some kind of agreement between some feature of the main verb (a tense feature, an aspectual one?) and the connective.</p>
<p>That this reconstruction of how LFs for complex tenses are derived is on the right track seems to be confirmed by the explicit attempt <link rid="b1">Ludlow makes (1999</link>: 126) at analyzing connectives such as <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> as the combination of a past or future tense morpheme and the connective <i>when</i>. The tense morpheme thus introduced takes narrow scope, so that the LFs in (100) can be replaced by the following ones:</p>

<p>With this, the truth-conditions for <i>John left</i> become <i>it was true that (it was true that John leave) when .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>&nbsp;, with the dots indicating the implicit <i>when</i>-clause. Note that (101) provides for a more straightforward derivation from the surface string than (100), and one which is more in line with current hypotheses about the syntax of tenses &ndash; e.g., <link rid="b17">Giorgi and Pianesi (1997</link>): the tense on the auxiliary (T1) takes wide scope over the whole sentence, whereas that contributed by the past participle (T2) takes scope only over the main clause. Hence, it seems advisable to drop (100) and directly consider (101) as candidate for the LF representation of complex tenses.</p>
<p>The second strategy suggested for complex tenses has the advantage of providing an acceptable treatment of the present perfect tense. This is missing from Ludlow&apos;s inventory; if we try to fill this gap by applying the first procedure sketched above, we obtain for <i>John has left</i> the following LF, which is clearly wrong (contradictory, it seems):</p>
<p>(102)&ensp;Tpres &lsqb;<sub>S</sub> John leave&rsqb; before Tpres &lsqb; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;.</p>
<p>If the second strategy is used (the one exploiting <i>when</i>-clauses with T2 taking narrow scope over the main clause), then we have:</p>
<p>(103)&ensp;Tpres &lsqb;Tpast &lsqb;John leave&rsqb; when &lsqb; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;&rsqb;.</p>
<p>This representation does not yield contradiction, and has truth-conditions to the effect that <i>John has left</i> is true iff <i>it is true that (it was true that John leave) when .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</i>&nbsp;, where the dots, as usual, stand for the implicit <i>when</i>-clause. Given that the tense having scope over the latter is the outermost present, we can conclude that <i>John has left</i> is true iff <i>it was true that John leave when I speak</i>.</p>
<p>This reconstruction of the present perfect is quite faithful to <link rid="b10">Reichenbach&apos;s (1947</link>) intuition, which distinguished the present perfect from the simple past because with the former the reference time is/overlaps with the speech time, whereas in the latter the reference time is/overlaps with the event time. In the current A-series theory, the simple past features a <i>when</i>-clause in the scope of a past tense:</p>
<p>(104)&ensp;Tpast&lsqb;<sub>S</sub> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb; when Tpast &lsqb;<sub>S</sub> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;</p>
<p>whereas the present perfect has a present tense <i>when</i>-clause (cf. (103)). The presence of the latter is crucial for the A-series account of the present perfect, much as the idea that the reference time is/overlaps with the speech time was for Reichenbach: without it, (103) would reduce to the simple fact that <i>it was true that John leave</i>, thus becoming very similar to (104). It should also be recalled that the first attempts at capturing the semantics of the present perfect within a tense logical approach failed because it was analyzed as the combination Pres Past&lsqb;<sub>S</sub> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;, which reduces to Past&lsqb;<sub>S</sub> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&rsqb;, this being the same representation postulated for the simple past. What those theories lacked was the acknowledgment (and means) of the role of contextual factors in tense interpretation, something stressed by Reichenbach and his followers through the use of reference time. Ludlow&apos;s tensed theory avoids this problem thanks to the device of <i>when</i>-clauses and E-type anaphora.</p>

<heading id="h14" level="1">5&ensp;Conclusion</heading>
<p>To conclude, it seems that the non-referential, tensed approach (as worked out by Ludlow) fares well with tenses (in both main and subordinate clauses), and that their treatment as indexical predicates and the disquotational semantics given can be very promising both theoretically and empirically.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the theory, as it stands now, still has technical and conceptual problems with temporal phrases and temporal quantification. For the former, problems arise both on the syntactic side (the structure of partially implicit <i>when</i>-clauses) and on the semantic one (how should those phrases be analyzed when playing the role of subjects and/or objects?). With respect to temporal quantification, the idea of adopting a substitutional view is an intriguing one, sometimes considered by linguists too (for more on the topic, see <link rid="b46">Lewis 1985</link>, and <link rid="b47">Ludlow 1985</link>). However, it seems that more work is necessary before non-referential theories of temporal phrases and temporal quantification can fully compete with those made available by referential approaches.</p>
<p>We close this chapter by briefly returning to the linguistic/semantical reasons the A-theorist has for dropping temporal reference. In <link rid="ss10">section 4.1</link> it was argued that B-theories don&apos;t have the resources to account both for temporal indexicals and for sentences referring to linguistic tokens. One might wonder, in this connection, why that line of argumentation is not extended to indexicality in general, thence rejecting the referential view for objectual talk too. Problems similar to those discussed in <link rid="ss10">section 4.1</link> for time indexicals are, in fact, found with all of the so-called essential indexicals; witness the fact that <link rid="b42">Casta&ntilde;eda&apos;s (1967</link>) original observations were about the first person pronoun. Nonetheless, Ludlow, our A-theorist, does not seem willing to reject objectual reference along with temporal. Possibly this is due to the fact that he also has philosophical reasons (which we haven&apos;t discussed) for distrusting the referential view as applied to temporal talk, so that the linguistic/semantical and the philosophical/metaphysical reasons reinforce each other. Thus, linguists who might not be convinced by the above line of argumentation about temporal indexicals, because, e.g., they are willing to maintain that part of the account of indexicals be outside semantics, should nevertheless face the philosophical arguments. However, the linguistic/semantical reasons might gain in importance if it could be argued that the proper treatment of indexicality is actually as suggested in <link rid="ss10">section 4.1</link>, but there is an asymmetry between temporal and objectual talk, which motivates maintaining a referential apparatus for the latter while discarding it for the former.</p>
<p>Perhaps such an argument can be based on the idea that indexicality seems a much more wide-spread and fundamental phenomenon in the temporal domain than in the objectual one. Besides tenses and such terms as <i>yesterday</i>, <i>tomorrow</i>, etc., even <i>three o&rsquo;clock</i> or <i>February 15</i> are indexical (or, more generally, context dependent). The only expressions that do not seem to fall within such a generalization are those providing full specification, e.g., <i>April 25</i>, <i>2002</i>. These too interact with tenses, though, so that there seem to be enough reasons for maintaining that indexicality/context dependence is the rule for temporal talk. If so, the linguistic/semantical argument that Ludlow deploys could be extended toward the general conclusion that indexicality always requires a non-referential, disquotational analysis (which can be complemented with a simulationist approach to propositional attitudes: see <link rid="ss13">section 4.4</link>). Those devices (almost) exhaust the requirements of temporal talk, whereas the ubiquity of non-indexical (non-context-dependent) objectual talk motivates also a referential apparatus for the latter.</p>

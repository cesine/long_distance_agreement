Subject: New DTD 3 stylesheets

<<File Attachment: ENTITYRC>>

I've done a new 'references linking info' stylesheet and re-organized
the stylesheets menu for DTD 3 SGML in Panorama. Save the attached to
your 'entityrc' folder, overwriting the old one,  and you'll see
them. The linking info stylesheet allows you to check quickly the
information from each reference that Synergy/Highwire use for
creating links from refs to Medline etc (journal title, date, vol.
no., first page no.).

I'm doing a QC checklist in the light of Synergy and Highwire
feedback: I'll have these for you next week.

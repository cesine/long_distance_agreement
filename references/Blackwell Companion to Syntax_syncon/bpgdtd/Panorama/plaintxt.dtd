
<!-- This DTD offers a simple way to read plain ASCII files
	and include very basic linking within them.

	To the top of any text file, add the following two lines:
		<!DOCTYPE plaintxt PUBLIC "plaintxt.dtd">
		<PLAINTXT>
	and at the end of the file, add:
		</PLAINTXT>

	To create a point which is linked "to*, in front of it
	type <LINKST ID="Ax"> where A is any alphabetic
	character or characters, and x is a number; after
	the anchor text, type </LINKST>.

	To create a link to that point, type 
	<LINKEND IDREF="Ax"> before the linking text,
	and </LINKEND> afterwards. The Ax should be the
	same for the link to work. You can have any number
	of <LINKEND> elements pointing to the same <LINKST>,
	but each <LINKST> must have a unique ID.

	In Panorama PRO, you may find it easier to not bother
	with the LINKST and LINKEND element types, but
	simply to highlight a phrase, click on Begin Link,
	highlight another (in the same or another document)
	and then click on Connect Link.


Here are the things u might need to change.

1.    The numbering of the examples is messed up.

2.    Example 7:  can have laga or lage and they have essential the same meaning. (maybe a slightly increased 'conditional' feeling with lage).  'zurud' should be 'zurur' (unless it is some special pakistani dialect).  and Bhagoongi (run.1sg+FUT) is better than bhag jaoongi for the meaning u want.

3.    Example 8:  gaa (towards the end of the sentence) is FUT.masculine  (as opposed to 'gii' FUT.feminine). And I think it duungaa is one word.

4.    Para 2, last line: This structural case can be realized on pronouns, adjectives, nouns (in 1), the genitive postposition, postpositions (in 3), gerunds (in 4), the same grammatical categories as in German (2).
I think ordering the examples so that German comes after the data u show might be better. And I think u should take out 'in' when u say 'in 1' or 'in 2'... cos 'in' is implicit in '(1)' or '(2)'...

5.    Para 3, 1st line, last word:  it should be "it's"  not "its"

6.    Para 3, 4th line: This is needed for her analysis reducing absolutive to nominative or default in different languages.
It is unclear what her analysis is from the above description. U might have to rephrase it.

7.    Para 3, line 6: As this the case assigners
I think it should be "As these case assigners are..."

8.    I think the rest of it is OK. There is only one more thing you might need to add or think about. The implications. You need to come up with implications that are (reasonably) immediately obvious from the data you present, but extend to the general understanding of the morpho-syntactive topic under consideration. I know you have had difficulty with this, but this is almost a pre-requisite to ensure another's interest in the topic. Keep thinking about it. My bet is that if u understand ur data well, and understand the problem (if any) than recent theories face, then the implications will become obvious to u.

These projections occur between Force and Finiteness, which delimit the complementizer system, and may be realized by various modal particles in Saramaccan and Gungbe. It is argued that the Saramaccan form `fu' represents two complementizers typels `fu1', which encodes irrealis mood under Force, and fu2, which realized deontic modality under Finiteness. The same holds for the Gungbe conditional complementizer ni1, which merges under Force, and ni2, which expresses deontic modality under Fin. This would mean that both Force and Fin express mood specifications, contrary to what is commonly assumed in the literature.}}

The crucial diagnostics are not locality effets, but identity effects. We implement the base-genearation analysis using a small set of semantically interpretable features, together with a simple universal syntax-semantics correspondence. We show that parametric varition arises because of the different ways the features are bundled on functional heads. We further argue that it is the bundling of two features on a single lexical item, together with the correspondence that requires them to be interpreted apart, that is presponsible for the displacement property of human languages.}}

A dominant  alignment constraint ALLFTL, requiring feet to be aligned as much as possible to the left  edge of the prosodic word, is responsible for the generation of metrical structures where  feet are left-aligned. Right-alignment, on the other hand, is not the result of an alignment  constraint, but the consequence of the rhythmical constraints *CLASH and *LAPSE  demanding alternating rhythm. This approach to directionality makes the right typological  predictions excluding from the set of possible metrical structures right-aligning  iambic systems, which are not attested among the worlda�s languages. The interaction  between the constraints determining rhythmical secondary stress and the constraints  determining main stress placement is discussed and it is shown how one more typological  observation, the non-existence of initial dactyl systems, is predicted by the system.}}

I show that these properties lead to a new generalization that can be derived  from independent assumptions about the syntax-phonology interface, according to  which an intonational phrase whose boundary cannot be properly demarcated is  disallowed in PF. I argue that this is exactly why null complementizer clauses are ruled  out in certain syntactic positions. I also discuss a parallelism between intonational  phrases and the notion of phase proposed by Chomsky (2000, 2001).}}

This paper examines two phonological  processes that simultaneously exhibit both phenomena: Assibilation and Apocope  in Finnish. The evidence converges on two main conclusions. First, variation  results from the presence of MULTIPLE METRICAL SYSTEMS within Finnish. Assibilation  and Apocope are metrically conditioned alternations and the segmental  variation reflects metrical variation. The metrical analysis explains a number of  apparently unrelated phenomena, including typological asymmetries across dialects, quantitative asymmetries within dialects, differences between nouns and  verbs, differences among noun classes, and the loci of lexical frequency effects.  Second, phonological opacity arises from MORPHOLOGICAL LEVEL ORDERING. By  interleaving transparent phonologies with independently motivated morphosyntactic  constituents (stems, words, phrases) we derive the transparent and opaque  interactions of four phonological processes, including Assibilation and Apocope.}}

Lebanese Arabic distinguishes between tru resumption, where a pronoun or an epithet phrase is related to an A'-antecedent via Move. Only apparent resumption displays reconstruction effects for scope and binding. As resumptives, strong pronouns and epithet phrases cannot be related to a quantificational antecedent unless they occur inside islands. We account for this Obviation Requirement as follwos: (a) (true) resumption is a last resort device, (b) strong pronouns and epithet phrases in apparent resumption contexts are generated as appositive modifiers of a DP, which is fronted to an A'-position, and (c) appositive modifiers are interpreted as independent clauses. Obviation is reduced to the inability of quantifiers to bind a pronominal element across sentential boundaries.}}

Lillo-Martin (1986, 1991) claims that American Sign Language (ASL) exploits both strategies for licensing null arguments, depending on the morphological characteristics of the verb. Here we show that this is incorrect. Once the nonmanual correlates of agreement features (comparable to the nonmanual expressions of other syntactic features) in ASL are recognized, it becomes apparent that null argument in this language are systematically licnesed by an expression of syntactic agreement.}}

The evidence for the nonconstituency of the verb and its  original arguments inpreposed position comes from its solution to what has been termed Pesetsky's  paradox, in that an object of a preposed VP can bind into an adverbial at the end of a sentence, creating an apparent conflict between the assumptions that binding requires c-command and that  only constituents move. This article also provides evidence for c-command as the prominence  constraint on binding, rather than o-command (Pollard & Sag 1994) or f-command (Dalrymple  1999).*}}

As our description illustrates, the set of contexts where "do"-support applies in this language is a proper subset of the English contexts. The syntax of fa-support in a language with typical Romance features allows us to draw some general conclusions regarding the analysis of English do-support and the interfaces between syntax and morphology, on one side, and syntax and lexical-semantic structure, on the other. First we will show how fa-support in this Romance langauge constitutes evidence in favor of the hypothesis that V to C movement applies also in Romance main questions. Second, some aspects of Rizzi's (1991) proposal that subject sh-sentences have a CP structure with the wh- in SpecC is confirmed by the presence of an overt complementizer in the language we are dealing with. Thirdly, the phenomenon of Romance fa-support will lead us to further develop Pollock's idea that do-insertion is directly connected with the theta-grid of a verb: a main verb cannot move to a thematically opaque position, while auxiliaries can, as they do not have a theta-grid. In the Romance dialect we analyze some verbs move to C (or use do-support) independently of their use as auxiliaries or as main verbs. In order to account for this aspect of the phenomenon, we suggest a more detailed description of the process.}}

Shlonsky (1991) argues that in both patterns Q heads a QP projection with the NP as a complement that may undergo movement to [Spec, QP] or beyond to yield the NP_Q pattern and Q-float structures. On the contrary, I argue on the basis of evidence from reconstruction, Case, and agreement that the two patterrns are radically different. In the Q_NP pattern Q is indeed the head of a QP projection that contains the NP. In the NP_Q pattern, however, Q heads a QP adjunct that modifies the NP and in some cases the VP.}}

Regarding when they have sh-movement, MWFL behave like non-MWFL: some behave like English (they always have wh-movement), some like Chinese (they never have it), and some like French (they have it optionally although, as in French, wh-movement is sometimes required). MWFL differ from English, Chinese, and French in that in MWFL even wh-phrases that do not undergo wh-movement still must front for an independent reason, argued to involve focus. The fronting has several exceptions (semantic, phonological, and syntactic in nature), explanation for which leads me to posit a new type of in-situ wh-phrase and argue for the possibility of pronunciation of lower copies of chains.}}

Mirror theory is an attempt to look at some of the central properties of syntactic representations in this spirit.  The core hypothesis of this theory is that in syntactic representations complementation expresses morphological structure: X is the complement of Y only if Y-X form a morphological unit -- a word. A second central assumption is the elimination of phrasal projection: a head X in a syntactic tree should be taken to ambiguously represent both the zero-level head(s) and its (their) associated phrasal node(s).}}

This article shows, through a typological  survey and a detailed comparison of Passamaquoddy and Mandarin  Chinese, that there is no connection between wh-in-situ and either  property. Passamaquoddy uses wh-words as indefinites in all the contexts  Chinese does, but it is a robust wh-movement language. Crosslinguistically, languages of all possible types are attested: most crucially,	wh-in-situ languages without question particles exist, and wh-in-situ  languages that do not use wh-words as indefinites also exist. In fact, most languages, regardless of whether they are wh-movement or whin-  situ languages, have question particles, and most languages use whwords  as indefinites.}}

It is shown  that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological  characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo  grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of  categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances  under the pressure of newer formations.

But raising of inflected APs and KPs into checking relations with N cannot be motivated, in Chomsky's system, since N has no uninterpretable features that these items can check. ASsuming Kayne's (1994, 1998) proposal for APs, the problem can be partially overcome, but inflected 'of' constructions still lack an account. Chomsky's (1998) probe-goal approach applied to concord also encounters difficulties, avoided under revision of the (1995) system: if the phi-features of APs and KPs drive them to raise for checking, correct results are obtained.}}

This construction is used to translate Italian relative clauses by native  signers of LIS. We show, however, that it differs from Italian relative clauses both  syntactically and semantically. From a syntactic standpoint, we argue that PROREL  clauses are correlative constructions on a par with left-adjoined relative clauses investigated  for Hindi by Dayal (Locality in WH quantification: Questions and relative  clauses in Hindi. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996). On the semantic  side, we argue however that unlike Hindi correlatives, PROREL clauses lack restrictive  interpretations and are interpreted instead as subject-predicate structures. In  this respect, they are similar to Japanese internally headed relative clauses (IHRCs)  investigated by Shimoyama (Journal of East Asian Linguistics 8:147--182, 1999). We  propose that like Japanese IHRCs in Shimoyama's proposal, PROREL clauses are  related to the main clause via e-type anaphora.}}

The participants for each experiment were 80 Chinese-speaking children between the ages of 3 and 8, plus 16 adults (recruited from Taipei, Taiwan). The results of the study indicate the following points: (1) Chinese children, in early stages of language acquisition (even as young as 3 years), honor the grammatical count-mass distinction which, as suggested by Cheng and Sybesma (1998, 1999), is reflected at the level of the classifier. (2) chinese children are capable of making fine differentiations between and among a given set of count-classifiers. They know that the relationship bewteen a count-classifier and an entity dentoed by a noun is relatively fixed. (3) Chinese children's abilities in dealing with mass-classifiers are comparable  to their abilities in dealing with count-classifiers. (4) Although there are developmental differences across the classifiers tested (presumably due to lexical learning), these differences tend to fade by age 4. (5) The general classifier \emph{ge} differed in that it does not require that the entity denoted by the noun be of a particular type. This was seen even in adults to some degree. The results of this study cohere with the linguistic analysis proposed by Cheng and Sybesma that the count-mass distinction is in fact relevant in chinese grammar. These results also cohere with the current theory in cognitive development proposed by Soja, Carey and Spelke (1991) that the ontological constraint reflected in the count-mass distinction is available in early stages of language acquisition.}}

The examination of the PC in TDE is of typological interest inasmuch  as it resembles similar constructions in certain West African languages. A PC  renders focus or contrastive focus to a verb in a given sentence by copying the  verb and preposing it. Similar verb focusing constructions have been observed for  many West African languages, including Vata and Nweh, as well as for Caribbean  Creoles (Koopman 1984, Piou 1982). The PC in TDE is also of theoretical  interest when combined with wh-question formation; the wh-subject/object asymmetries  explored here provide interesting support for an escape hatch for whphrases  in an intermediate position between VP and Tense that is comparable to  a VP-adjoined position (Chomsky 1986). Evidence is also provided for a CP-like  domain lower in the clause; I argue that both a wh-phrase and a verb focused  in a PC have focus features that must be checked in a Focus Phrase (FocP). The  current investigation enriches the characterization of both PCs and wh-question  formation by looking not only at each operation individually but also examining  their interaction with one another as well as with adverbs.}}

Subsequent research has revealed that variation within one dialect is quite common. Previous accounts of yes-no question patterns in Southern Min dialects have shown that most have more than one pattern. The present study shows that in some Fujian Southern Min dialects the patterns VP-neg and Adv-VP are mutually exclusive. Data from Xiamen is also presented to show recent innovations in the yes-no question pattern. This innovation is described with a view towards explaining how the origin of the innovative patterns and limitations on their further development are influenced by the distribution of the negatives and modal verbs.}}

The key to this puzzle lies at  the syntax-semantics interface: plural adjectives are required in cases of NATURAL COORDINATION, where a salient close relation holds between the conjuncts, but disallowed in cases of ACCIDENTAL  COORDINATION. The semantic distinction between natural and accidental coordination has a syntactic  reflex in Finnish, where only the features of the natural-coordination structure are compatible  with the agreement requirements of plural adjectives. We show that the distinction between natural  and accidental coordination is syntactically reflected not only in Finnish, but in other languages  as well, including Tundra Nenets, Russian, and Kurdish.*}}

This article explores the  hypothesis that lack of an object marker when the object is indefinite follows from  lack of abstract Case on indefinite objects. It is shown that indefinites in Hebrew are  allowed in various other positions in which Case seems to be unavailable and in which  definites are not allowed, a fact that receives a straightforward account under the  proposed hypothesis that indefinites do not require Case. The possibility of having  Caseless indefinites is then argued to follow from lack of a DP projection in Hebrew  indefinites. The second part of this article aims to show that an analysis of indefinites  in Hebrew as lacking a DP projection is indeed possible and can be motivated  on independent grounds. This involves a reexamination of the arguments that have  motivated the influential N-to-D analysis of Semitic noun phrases. I claim that most  previous work on Semitic nominals is in fact compatible with an analysis in which  nouns do not raise as high as the D position, and that the hypothesis that indefinites  in Hebrew are not full DPs has some explanatory advantages over the view that all  construct state nominals in Hebrew are DPs.}}

Covering  data beyond the range of extant accounts, this paper presents an integrated solution  to both puzzles. The paper's central claim is that both either and or are phrasal  categories. They originate in a position adjoined to their disjunct, to the contrastive  focus or to a higher node on the `h-path' projected from the contrastive focus.  Though either itself is immobile, its [+NEG] counterpart, neither, can undergo  phrasal movement from its base-generation site to a higher position in the tree, from  which it triggers negative inversion; [+WH] whether must move to SpecCP; and or  and [+NEG] nor must, if they are not base-generated there, front to the initial  position in the second disjunct in order to be able to participate in a feature-checking  relationship with the abstract head J(unction), the functional head that takes the  second disjunct as its complement and the first disjunct as its specifier. The movement  of whether, neither and (n)or will be diagnosed on the basis of the familiar  restrictions on movement.}}

In this part of the Latin verbal system, active forms are synthetic ("verbs") but passive forms are analytic (i.e., participle and finite auxiliary). I show that the two perfects occur in essentially the same structure and are distinguished by a difference in movemetn to T; moreover, the difference in forms can be derived without reference to category labels like "verb" or "adjective" on the Root. In addition, the difference in perfects is determined by a feature with clear syntactic consequences, which must be assoicated arbitrarily with certain Roots, the deponent verbs. I discuss the implications of these points in the context of Distributed Morphology, the theory in which the analysis is framed.}}

Patterns of analytic/synthetic  alternation, in which two-word and one-word forms alternate with each other, have  been taken to be instances of blocking in this sense. An example is found in the formation  of English comparatives and superlatives, where, for example, the synthetic form  smarter appears to block the analytic form *more smart. Analytic forms are available  in other cases (e.g. more intelligent), such that the interaction between the ``one word''  and ``two word'' forms is crucially at issue. This paper examines English comparative  and superlative formation, concentrating on the question of how the morphophonology  relates to syntax and semantics. A central point is that in the architecture of  Distributed Morphology, these cases do not involve word/word or word/phrase competition-  based blocking. Rather, blocking effects broadly construed are reduced to the  effects of distinct mechanisms: (1) Vocabulary Insertion at a particular terminal node  (morpheme), and (2) the operation of combinatory processes. The paper provides  a detailed discussion of the latter type, showing that synthetic comparative/superlative  forms are created post-syntactically by affixation under adjacency. Throughout  the discussion, questions concerning the status of blocking effects in Distributed Morphology, and those  found in analytic/synthetic alternations in particular, play a central role.}}

In an Austinian   theory of assertive speech acts, four types of assertive speech act are distinguished.   It is argued here that the dimensions along which the structures of these speech acts   vary are the dimensions that serve to explain the presence of -wa. Furthermore, the   various uses of -wathat have been identified in the literature, including the thematic   and contrastive uses, are brought under a unified system. There are, however, two more   general themes that are addressed here. First, it is claimed that, once a principled theory   of speech acts is in play, the relative contributions of syntax and semantics to the study   of natural language become more easy to distinguish. This provides an antidote to   the tendency to syntacticize problems that are properly pragmatic (or pragmaticize   problems that are properly syntactic, etc.). The attempt is made to separate these   domains without favor. The other theme involves Austin's account of predication in   terms of matching types of items and senses of predicates. That proposal, which   stands in contrast to common assumptions in the semantics literature, and which is   central to his account of assertive speech acts, deserves attention}}

I examine a range of possible locality constraints on movement that are representative of current approaches. I expose some important formal differences among these alternatives and examine five phenomena, some previously unnoted, that distinguish them empirically. No single approach succeeds in capturing all of the facts that should arguably follow from a theory of locality, but the bulk of the evidence seems to support a theory that defines locality using only simple and independently motivated syntactic objects and relations.}}

Support for  this conclusion comes from a phenomenon of question truncation that I call auxdrop.  I show that aux-drop questions differ minimally from full questions in that  their auxiliary, though present early in the derivation, moves to a position in which it  is interpreted neither phonologically nor semantically. I also argue that this deletion  through movement is not subject to a recoverability condition. The analysis finds a  natural place in a theory where head movement is syntactic (not purely phonological)  and spell-out is cyclic. This approach explains the emergence of the factative effect --  a type of tense interpretation pattern found in ``bare sentences'' in, e.g., Haitian  Creole and F cngbe` -- in an obscure corner of certain languages that normally require  full tense specification in finite clauses. My approach finds further support in the  patterning of aux-drop questions with VP topicalization and pseudoclefts with  respect to morphological mismatch, a pattern of verbal perfect interpretation in the  absence of participial morphology.}}

The  syntactic and semantic characteristics of these complements account  straightforwardly for well-known differences between FI and FP, including  the previously untreated ``obligation'' requirement in FI, absent  in FP. Our analysis also accounts for another subtle restriction  on the formation of FP: the existence of an animacy requirement on  the subject of fare, absent in FI.

It presents new evidence that Condition C applies at (and only at) LF and demonstrates that this condition can serve as a powerful tool for distinguishing among various claims regarding the nature of LF and the inventory of semantic mechanisms. The conclusions reached are these (1) Scope reconstruction is represented in the syntax (semantic type-shifting operations are very limited). (2) A'-chains have the following properties: (a) Scope reconstruction results from deleting the head of the chain and interpreting the head of the chain with a copy of the restrictor at the tail (unless this option is impossible, as in antecedent-contained deletion, in which case the copy is changed to a variable as in standard notations). (c) VP adjunction is an intermediate landing site. (3) A-chains are different in a way that at the moment requires a stipulative distinction.}}

Coverbs  resist extraction of their objects by topicalization or relativization, a fact  which has often been explained in terms of a preposition-stranding constraint in  accounts of similar facts in Mandarin. However, Cantonese coverbs display the  morphosyntactic properties of verbs, suggesting that they cannot be prepositions.  In this paper, we propose that coverbs are verbs, and that the relevant extraction  constraint is a kind of adjunct island constraint. This proposal is supported  with experimental evidence from a sentence judgment task. Two key findings are  as follows: (1) listeners judged extraction from a coverb phrase as significantly  less acceptable than extraction from a simple clause; (2) listeners judged sentences  both with and without aspectual marking (verbal morphosyntax) on the  coverb as highly acceptable. Together, these findings support our proposal that  coverbs are verbs (not prepositions) and that coverb phrases form a kind of  adjunct island. However, we show that existing adjunct island conditions (such as  the CED) are not adequate to account for our data. Following Hawkins' (1999)  processing-based theory of filler-gap dependencies, we propose a simple, languagespecific  formulation of the extraction constraint, and we argue that this constraint  is more generally motivated by a processing principle called Avoid Competing  Subcategorizers -- one of the same principles that motivates preposition-stranding  constraints in other languages. Thus, although object extraction is prohibited by  a kind of adjunct island constraint, the function of the constraint in processing  efficiency is similar to that of a preposition-stranding constraint.}}

Fukui (1995)), with a special focus on the nature and role of linear order and functional categories. A hypothesis called the "Symmetry of Derivation" is put forth, according to which the computations in the overt syntax (i.e., the pre-Spell-Out computations) and the computations in the (pre-Morphology) phonological component are "symmetric" in the sense that they form mirror images of each other. More specifically, we propose that language computation maps an array of linguistic elements to an interface representation in such a way that it starts with a lexical item (a head) proceeding in a bottom-up fashion (Merge) and at some point of this step-by-step derivational process (Spell-Out) starts "decomposing" the structures already formed in a top-down fashion ("Demerge") until the derivation reaches a completely unstructured sequence with a fixed linear order.  It is shown that this symmetry principle explains the major properties of phrsae structure in an elegant way. The principle accounts for the apparently universal "leftness" property of Spec in a straightforward way by attributing its leftness to the top-down computation Demerge encounters. With respect to the order between head and its complement, wich allows for cross-linguistic variation (head-initial vs. head-last), the symmetry principle predicts that the head-last order is derived by movement, in clear contrast with Kayne's (1994) approach. The difference between head-initial English adn head-last Japanese is, then, attributed to different propoerties of "light verb" v (Chomsky (1995b)): v has the property of attracting V in English but not in Japanese. Numerous theoretical and empirical consequences are shown to follow in an interesting way from this hypothesis, coupled with the symmetry principle of derivations.}}

Recently, Koizumi (2000) has put forward direct evidence for verb-raising drawing on data involving, among oter things, numeral classifiers. Based on relevant and important fats that are overlooked by Koizumi and other researchers, this paper demonstrates that the alleged evidence based on the behavior of numeral classifiers does not support his claim that verb-raising occurs in Japanese. The apparently odd behavior of such classifiers (which can give rise to unusual looking constituents) noted by Koizumi will be given a semantic account. The present account is also capable of dealing with additional data wiht numeral classifiers that are problematic for him.}}

I discuss the behavior of three lexically distinct Greek counterparts  of even in positive, negative, subjunctive sentences, and polar questions. These items  are shown to be polarity sensitive, and a three-way distinction is posited between a  positive polarity (akomi ke), a negative polarity (oute), and a `flexible scale'even (esto)  which does not introduce likelihood, but is associated with scales made salient by the  context. The analysis is a refinement of Rooth's original idea that negative polarity  is involved in the interpretation of English even, and establishes further that the  ``negative'' polarity domain of EVEN includes a sensitivity that is not strictly speaking  negative (flexible scale esto). The distributional restrictions of EVEN items are shown  to follow from distinct presuppositions (positive polarity and flexible scale EVEN), or from their lexical featural specification (negative polarity EVEN), a result that  squares neatly with the fact that ill-formedness is systematic pragmatic deviance in  the former case but robust ungrammaticality in the latter. This result supports the by  now widely accepted view that polarity dependencies are not of uniform nature, and  that we need to distinguish presupposition failures (which are weaker and possibly  fixable in some contexts) from cases of ungrammaticality which are robust and cannot  be fixed in any context (Giannakidou, 2001).}}

It is proposed  that the properties determining the temporal location of events at the interface  level --- i.e., Sequence of Tense --- also allow the identification of the antecedent of  long distance anaphors. The paper focuses on so-called blocking effects---namely, the  impossibility for a long distance anaphor to extend its binding domain beyond certain  elements, such as an indicative verbal form in Italian or an indexical or context-related  item in Chinese. I also consider backward binding phenomena, and show how they  might follow from the same generalizations. The paper investigates the role of the  speaker and the bearer of attitude in the sentence, and capitalizing on the proposals by  Giorgi and Pianesi (1997, 2001a, 2001b, 2004a, 2004b) on Sequence of Tense, argues  that they are syntactically realized and might act as binders and blockers both for  temporal anchoring and for binding.}}

Children at the   same age acquiring other languages make errors with subject case and with tense or   agreement inflections on the verb, which has been analyzed by Wexler (1998) as   stemming from a constraint on child grammars that prevents the subject from moving   to two functional projections. The proposal here is that the child Korean errors result   from the same constraint. This leads to an analysis of negation in adult Korean under   which the VP material is base generated between the negator anand the verb, moving   leftward in adult Korean. The child errors are then a result of omitting object-related   functional projections that would drive this movement, paralleling Wexler's analysis   of Optional Infinitives in other languages. The analysis presented here not only offers   an explanation of the child errors but also constrains the possible analyses for negation   in adult Korean in ways that are not obvious from the adult data alone.}}

Complex Predicates presents this wide area of phenomena in a  concise and insightful manner, and develops an analysis that is based on few specific  assumptions in the framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG).  This said, the book obviously targets an audience wider than HPSG. Chapter 1 offers  a brief introduction into general assumptions of the framework, developed along  with a basic HPSG-analysis of German clause structure, and throughout the book  the author has made every effort to find a good balance between empirical scrutiny, theoretical explicitness, and accessibility for readers who are not familiar with  HPSG. Comparable monographs are hard to find and badly needed.}}

If the language  has a cliticlike negation that associates with the verb in syntax, then  scope facts concerning negation and a quantified object NP could  provide evidence regarding the height of the verb. Even so, such facts  are rare, especially in the input to children, and so we might expect  that not all speakers exposed to a head-final language acquire the same  grammar as far as V-raising is concerned. Here, we present evidence  supporting this expectation. Using experimental data concerning the  scope of quantified NPs and negation in Korean, elicited from both  adults and 4-year-old children, we show that there are two populations  of Korean speakers: one with V-raising and one without.}}

They therefore specify both that the NP to the left is  a subject, and that the NP to the right is an object, and they cannot be bracketed  uniquely with either. This is shown by the fact that these morphemes are absent when  either subject or object position is (structurally and phonologically) absent, for example  due to extraction. This is the only morphological case-marking in the relevant  languages. The operation inserting such morphemes must have reference to constituent  structure (NP), abstract case (subject, object), and linear adjacency. These data  increase the evidence that complex case-marking operations can apply in a centrally  located morphology component that has simultaneous access to categorial and linear  relations. The idea is questionable that such morphological operations take place at a  syntax/PF interface, where syntactic categories are first aligned with prosodic phrases, since actual prosodic (e.g. accentual) bracketings do not always coincide with the  bracketings relevant to case morphology. This point is made with data from Tamashek  (Berber) nominal prefix alternations, preceding the main section on Songhay  case marking.}}

The main claims are that plural/mass denotations are built   in stages within the DP, by the combined effect of number features and semantic   operators associated with functional heads; that languages differ in whether the deno-   tation of nouns is filtered for singular or plural number; and that the word and cross-   linguistically denotes SET PRODUCT, an operation which, in different contexts, can mimic   the behavior of intersection and union.}}

The theory accounts for most of the properties of SF: why it applies only when there is a subject gap; why it affects almost any cateogry, head or phrase; the locality conditions; and the crosslinguistic variation. SF belongs to Narrow Syntax, not the phonological component. Althought the features moved by SF are invisible at LF, the specifier position created by SF is visible and is used by other categories that are visible at LF but invisible at PF.}}

In contrast to the diachronic account presented in Li (1977), which assumes, based on cognate comparison among Rukai dialects, that Maga mid vowels derive historically from Proto Rukai, the current work draws evidence from alternations found in Maga and proposes that the mid vowels are not inherited nor underlyingly present but are surface variants of high vowels., generated by synchronic processes. Two other phenomena, echo vowel insertion and \emph{e~r/o~v} alternation, are examined in connection with mid vowel formation. It is shown in the discussion that the proposed synchronic approach not only provides an answer to soem unresolved issues related to Maga mid vowels, thus shedding light on our understanding of Maga's vocalic inventories, but also reveals the interactions among various processes and hence offers insight into the unified mechanisms that tie together the alternations in the language.}}

If there is a tie, the first segment gets linked by temporal sequence. V-neutralization (Chung 1996) turns mid vowels into high when they form rimes with the adjacent vowels.

Our study is based on the longitudinal data of three children  ages 19--32 months, and is to our knowledge the first systematic investigation  of the acquisition of Malagasy. The Malagasy voicing system has a distinctive morphology  and involves the promotion of an argument (actor, theme, instrument, etc.)  to a referentially and syntactically prominent position, typically clause-final.We look  at two competing accounts of the Malagasy voicing system, one in which the promoted  argument is analyzed as a subject and the promotion operation an instance of  A-movement (Guilfoyle, Hung, & Travis, 1992) and a more recent account in which  Malagasy is analyzed as a V2-like language in which the promoted argument is a topic  and the promotion an instance of A -movement (Pearson, M. (2001); Pearson, M. (2005)).   Both analyses have clear implications for acquisition, which we examine in  this paper. Our acquisition results favor the analysis of the promoted argument as  an A -element. We also show that there is a developmental stage in Malagasy that  parallels the root infinitive (RI) stage widely observed in various European languages.  Apparent differences between the Germanic RIs and the analogous phenomenon in  Malagasy are derived from differences in the functional structure associated with a  voicing system as opposed to an agreement system.}}

First, Banawa stress is sensitive to the presence  or absence ofsyllable onsets; second, Banawa tolerates monomoraic  feet yet requires a bimoraic minimal word; and, third, it seems to  employ mora-based footing that is free to ignore syllable boundaries.  In this article, I argue that these issues are not nearly as problematic  as they might first appear. The article demonstrates that Banawa's  onset sensitivity can be produced by a constraint aligning the head  syllables off eet with onsets, that its minimal word restriction can be  produced with Nonfinality constraints, and that it can maintain syllable  integrity simply by giving clash and lapse avoidance priority over  other footing considerations.}}

Non-case-marked FQs are assigned   the category of NP modifier, i.e., NP\NP and this categorization, together with the   combinatorial operation of functional composition, can handle the basic cases of   subject/object asymmetry. An FQ in front of a transitive verb can compose with the   verb, making itself related only to the object, but not to the subject. Case-marked   FQs show no such asymmetry and they can be handled when they are assigned cat-   egories of VP or TV modifiers.   Discourse factors are also relevant for FQs particularly because FQs with discourse   markers, which signify some discourse-relevant prominence, enjoy the full freedom   of word order as usual adverbs. Non-case-marked FQs can also be used as adver-   bials in a strong discourse context such as a ``contrastive'' one or nonconstituent   coordination construction, but discourse effects are not as strong in Korean as in   Japanese, as shown by still-awkward sentences with topicalized FQs. The absence   of discourse restriction of contrastiveness with respect to dative NP hosts is another   indication that Korean FQs are less affected by discourse factors than Japanese ones.   Discourse factors are more grammaticalized in Korean than in Japanese.}}

The analysis is crucially rests on the independently motivated single constituent structure of extended nominal phrases (see Kamio (1983), Terada (1990)). Within this analysis, various contrasts involving the scrambling of numerals, approximate numerals, and quantifiers (leaving behind their associated noun phrases), which have thus far resisted a principled explanation, are shown to be deducible from a natural interaction of two independently motivated analyses: (i) the proper Binding Condition analysis (see Saito (1989, 1992)) and (ii) the Mapping Hypothesis analysis (see Diesing (1992)).}}

Empirical consequences are explored in Hebrew, where infinitival complements to negative verbs ('refrain', 'prevent') display a number of surprising syntax-semantics correlations. Those are traced to the operation of negative features in the Comp position. The analysis also provides insight into the recalcitrant prevent DP from V-ing construction in English.}}

Contrary to this common assumption, this paper argues that "a noh" is a dynamic event description, focusing on culmination, whereas "a twu" is static, triggering a presupposition about the causal event. This opposition corresponds to a difference between asserting the completion of an event and asserting a current state resulting from a past event that is presupposed to have already taken place. This paper provides empirical evidence supporting this claim: the two markers are distinguished when embedded in change of state predicates in sentences. In discourse, "a noh" describes a following/preceding episode, whereas "a twu" expresses an overlapping state. The semantic differences between the two have been represented formally using the logical tools of Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle (1993)). In DRT, "a noh" moves the reference time (Rpt) forward, while "a twu" represents a state preserving the give Rpt.}}

The challenge is to understand the mechanisms  that make this dual functioning possible. Following Landau [Lingua 107 (1999) 1], this paper presents a POSSESSOR RAISING analysis, arguing that the POSSESSOR DATIVE  (PD) moves from the specifier of the possessed nominal to a verbal argument  position. The analysis is implemented in a dynamic structure-building framework, where heads with their selectional features are introduced in the course of the  derivation, and it is in principle possible that an argument that gets merged into the  structure to take on one thematic role raises into a newly built sentence domain to  fulfill another thematic role. This movement and the resulting double h-role  assignment are crucially driven by formal features; that is, both stem from the fact  that, in its origin site, the raised argument is not case-licensed. An additional caselicensing  head is needed for the derivation to converge. This head is an affectee light  verb which assigns inherent dative case to the argument in its specifier. Thus, unlike  Landau's account of PDCs in Hebrew, where PDs can be interpreted as affected without actually being h-related to the verb, the analysis here offers an explanation  for the crosslinguistically more general case of the PDC, where the PD's role as both  possessor and affectee needs to be syntactically encoded.}}

Besides normal distributive predicates, it can also occur with certain types of collective predicates. The difficulties of giving a compositional interpretation to constructions of these kids are discussed in detail. I show that we can solve those difficulties if we treat dou as a generalized distribtivity marker in the sense of Schwarzschild (1991, 1996), which distributes over the members of a plurality cover. Apart from the above topic, which is more narrowly a semantics topic, this paper also discusses some syntax-semantics interface issues related to the distribution of dou's associates.}}

A mid vowel preceded by a front rounded glide [ h], however, is only partially assimilated, resulting in a front unrounded [e] rather than the expected front rounded [o/]. This process of Mid Vowel Assimilation varies across Mandarin dialects depending on the features involved, the direction of feature spreading, and whether   or not a mid vowel is fully or partially assimilated. This article proposes a unified   constraint-based account of the variation and typology of Mid Vowel Assimilation   across Mandarin dialects. Couched within Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky   1993) and Feature Class Theory (Padgett 1995, 1996), the proposed analysis demon-   strates (i) how the interaction of gradient assimilation-related constraints and   markedness constraints on feature cooccurrence avoids marked segment types and   produces partial assimilation effects, and (ii) how different rankings of the proposed   set of constraints generate the variation pattern across Mandarin dialects. To fully   account for the typology of Mandarin Mid Vowel Assimilation and the uneven dis-   tribution of different types of Mid Vowel Assimilation, I suggest that (i) some   assimilation-related constraints can be categorically assessed as a marked option,   and (ii) some constraint rankings on markedness, while not universally fixed, can be   designated as universal default rankings.}}

For simplex sentences without time adverbs or aspectual marker, I show that temporal reference is correlated with aktionsart or grammatical viewpoint. For sentences with an aspecual marker, I discuss the temporal semantics of 'le' and 'guo' in detail, showing how their tense/aspectual meanings contribute to temporal reference. I propose to analyze 'le' as an event realization operator and 'guo' as ananteriority operator. For subordinate clauses, I show that temporal reference of complement clauses of verbs is basically determined by verbal semantics of individual verbs, which may impose some temporal restriction on the temporal location of the embedded event. As for relative clauses and temporal adverbial clauses, many different factors such as lexical verbal semantics, referential properties of determiners, lifteme effect of noun phrases, semantic or pragmatics constraints on termporal connectives, inference rules and world knowledge, etc., all interact to help determine temporal reference. Many data discussed in this paper indicate that there is no evidence of (covert) tenses in Chinese. Therefore, challenging work remains for those who have claimed that Tnese Phrase is projected in Chinese phrase structures.}}

These facts provide unambiguous evidence  for the indirect dependency approach to wh-scope marking advocated by Dayal (1994, 2000) where the embedded question provides a semantic restriction for thematrix whelement.  Dayal's theory will be extended to provide a compositional analysis of these  constructions. The extended approach argues for a generalization of the question-formation  procedure to different clause types, as first advocated in Sternefeld (2001).}}

Pure identity shown by the anphor \emph{ziji-benshen} 'self-self' can be derivable from the semanti composition of the near reflexive funtion of the morpheme z\emph{iji} 'self', the focus function of the morpheme \emph{benshen} 'self' and the operator status of \emph{ziji-benshen} 'self-self' while near identity (or near reflexivity) wshown by the \emph{non-X-benshen }'non-X-self' anaphor is due to its being"a pronoun in coreference." In other words, in Chinese pure identity is near reflexivity plus a focus marker which picks out the best representation of the antecedent that happens to be the actual person. Thus, the \emph{X-benshen }'X-self' anaphor should not be considered a pure anaphor without content. Typologically, there are two ways for human languages to get pure identity: One is by using an anaphorwithout content; the other is by using a focus marker that picks out the best representation of the antecedent which happens to be the actual person. The typological difference in establishing pure identity provides an answer for the long standing question of why the notion of coargumenthood is often adopted by linguists in defining binding conditions in languages which show an antilocality effect but seldom in Chinese. The distribution and coindexation of all Chinese anaphors, either the \emph{X-bensen} 'X-self' or the \emph{non-X-benshen} 'non-X-self' anaphor, are determined by one single syntactic condition, namely, the traditional binding theory, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the coargument domain. In contrast, in languages which show an antlocality effect, the binding theory allows both pure and near anaphors within the coargument domain but Condition R filters out one of them in the absence of lexical/morphological reflexivity; however, outside the coargument domain, the binding theory itself governs the distribution and coindexation of all anaphors.}}

In Task 1, elicited production data from both native   speakers of English and the PLEFL at different levels of proficiency shows that   neither group's responses are affected by the discourse factors. The native   speakers� performance can only be meaningfully interpreted when individual   verbs are brought into consideration; the Persian learners, excluding the   elementary ones, who consistently produce prepositional datives, echo the   construction in the question. In Task 2, data from acceptability judgements show   that the native speakers, advanced and high-intermediate subjects prefer the   responses with a Given-New order. The incongruity between the two tasks is   attributed to the nature of the tasks. Additionally, evidence is provided for the   existence of a very specific developmental sequence in the acquisition of the   interaction between discourse factors and dative alternation. The consequences of   the findings of this study for perspectives on interlanguage are discussed. }}

We argue that the construction is best analyzed as biclausal, containing  a covert matrix psych-predicate. We thus go against the monoclausal  treatment proposed by Rivero and Milojevic Sheppard (2003). The discussion  touches on a number of theoretical issues, such as (deficient) clausal complements, the phase theory, adverbial syntax, and the sententialist/intensionalist debate on  intensionality.}}

Evidence for this proposal comes from a difference observed in causative-inchative alternations of ditransitive verbs. One type of verb promotes the accusative arguemnt to the subject of the inchative variant, which is discussed in Baker (1993, 1995). However, the other type advances the dative argument to the subject. It is also claimed that th e dative arguments of the two types of verbs are distinguished by thematic role: one is goal, whereas the other is experiencer.

This is despite the fact that vowels at the  end of a domain (utterance, phrase, word) are generally longer in duration  than corresponding nonfinal vowels. We propose that the phonological pattern  of final shortening arises diachronically from the effects of final devoicing -- the  breakdown in voicing at the end of an utterance. Partial devoicing of the final  vowel makes it difficult to hear the end of the vowel and so favors identification  of final vowels as short. If language learners generalize such an identification  pattern, they have adopted a final shortening pattern. The claim that partially  voiceless final vowels tend to be identified as short is supported by a series of  experiments with Finnish speakers. The first two experiments establish that there  is both final lengthening and final devoicing in the language. Three further experiments  show that Finnish speakers identify the length category of partially voiceless  final vowels on the basis of the duration of its voiced portion, so that partial  devoicing of a vowel increases the probability of its being identified as short.}}

Firstly, it is one of only a few modal markers throughout Japanese language history   that have both deontic and epistemic meaning, which is very common in English   and other Indo-European languages. Secondly, it is said to be extremely polysemous.   There might be no other modal suffix in the history of the Japanese language that   has been associated with such a range and variety of meanings. There are also concrete   examples of beshi that are given divergent interpretations in grammatical analysis   and Modern Japanese translations.   The primary goal of this paper is to provide a principled explanation both for   the different ``meanings'' of beshi and for divergent interpretations that are due to   indeterminacy. It is argued that Old Japanese beshi from a synchronic point of view   basically has only a deontic and an epistemic sense, and other ``meanings'' can be   explained either in terms of vagueness or in terms of implicature in specific contexts.   Conditions are explained under which indeterminacy between the deontic and the   epistemic sense arises and compared with the conditions for indeterminacy and   deontic-epistemic polysemy to those observed in the history of modals in English   and German. Furthermore an account of the diachronic layering behind the syn-   chronic meaning range of beshi in Old Japanese is given. It is claimed that the   development of the meanings of beshi does not strictly adhere to the ``deontic-to-   epistemic'' pattern frequently found on Indo-European languages.}}

Three consequences follow: (a) the operation Attract F cannot be reduced to Agree, (b) the concept of strength is inescapable, and (c) some of the effects of strength are PF-driven properties, hence not true imperfections.}}

This construction is known to receive at last two distinct interpretations: on-going process interpretations analogous to the English progressive and so-called resultative interpretations. The latter are sub-classified by some researchers into concrete result state readings and experiential state readings. Based upon the distributional properties of adverbials, we suggest that progressive interpretations of DURATIVE VERBS and concrete result state interpretations of INSTANTANEOUS VERBS should be grouped together, as opposed to experiential readings of DURATIVE or INSTANTANEOUS VERBS. To account for the distinction between these two types of interpretation, the proposed system analyzes the -te iru form into the morpheme -te, which is claimed to bear a perfect feature, and the aspectual auxiliary iru. Our proposal for the aspectual auxiliary iru is an extension of Landman's (1992) proposal and offers a unified account of the multiple interpretations of -te iru on the basis of a new analysis of INSTANTANEOUS VERBS.}}

In appropriate  contexts, the verbal feature reduces to [PERSON] and the nominal feature to [CLASS].  This view, along with the fact that agreement features come in bundles, leads to a  novel way of looking at verba�subject agreement. Understood as the reflex of featurematching  and deletion, verba�subject agreement is essentially a mechanism of categorization  by computation. It leads to deletion of the nominal agreement feature  from the verb and related functional heads and the verbal agreement feature from the  subject. Further empirical support for this way of looking at agreement comes from  the antiagreement phenomenon, which turns out to be a reflex of the peculiar categorial  identity of the predicate in relevant sentences. The examples used in the  article are mainly from Berber.}}

Such constructions hold even greater interest for the question of the relation between  grammatical knowledge and real-time language processing. This article presents results from two  experiments on parasitic-gap constructions in English in which the parasitic gap appears inside  a subject island, before the licensing gap. An off-line studyconfirms that parasitic gaps are  acceptable when theyoccur inside the infinitival complement of a subject NP, but not when they  occur inside a finite relative clause. An on-line self-paced reading studyusing a plausibility  manipulation technique shows that incremental positing of gaps inside islands occurs in just those  environments where parasitic gaps are acceptable. The fact that parasitic gaps are constructed  incrementallyin language processing presents a challenge for attempts to explain subject islands  as epiphenomena of constraints on language processing and also helps to resolve apparent conflicts  in previous studies of the role of island constraints in parsing.*}}

Instead, we posit just one type of referentially dependent element -- reflexives -- which avail themselves of two options for being related to their antecedents, namely, syntactic binding adn discourse coreference. We focus on Chinese reflexive ziji but will also consider reflexives in American English and British English. Data from these languages indicate that obligatory binding (as stated in Principle A of Chomsky (1986)) is something of a special case and should not be taken as a general model for a cross-linguistic approach to reflexives. We also show that argument structure is relevant to long-distance binding in Chinese, and thus the syntactic binding domain can be defined in terms of relative OBLIQUENESS of grammatical relations rather than a purely tree-configurational relation, e.g., C-COMMAND.}}

The amount of material copied varies between a single C (mavit / ma-m-vit  `lion(s)') and CV (hodai / ho-ho-dai `rock(s)'). The former is preferred unless copying  a single C would give rise to an illicit coda or cluster, in which case CV is copied. In  contrast to previous analyses of similar patterns in Tohono O'odham and Lushootseed, I analyze the reduplicant as an infix rather than a prefix. The infixation of the  reduplicant can be generated via constraints requiring the first vowel of the stem to  correspond to the first vowel of the word. Furthermore, the preference for copying the  initial consonant of the word can be generated by extending positional faithfulness  to the base-reduplicant relationship. I argue that the infixation analysis is superior  on two grounds. First, it reduces the C vs. CV variation to an instance of reduplicant  size conditioned by phonotactics. Second, unlike the prefixation analyses, which must  introduce a new notion of faithfulness to allow syncope in the base just in the context  of reduplication (e.g. ``existential faithfulness'' (Struijke 2000a)), the infixation  analysis uses only independently necessary constraints of Correspondence Theory.}}

This is adduced from the behavior of guttural consonants in Semitic. It is further argued that antigemination is not resistance to an OCP violation but avoidance of gemination; syncope between identical consonants avoids an OCP violation by creating a geminate. This entails that there is no surface representational distinction between true and fake geminates. Finally, cases of reduplication are examined in which the standard reduplicant is changed to avoid either gemination or OCP violation.}}

The Halle-Sagey model predicts that  palatalization should be analyzed by assuming derivational levels and  is thus at odds with the tenet of strict parallelism in Optimality Theory.  In contrast, the Clements-Hume model appears to be able to achieve  the same goal without recourse to derivational stages because it is  based on the assumption that, in the ways relevant for palatalization, vowels and consonants are characterized by the same features. However, analysis of palatalization and related processes shows that this  assumption is incorrect. The consequence is that derivational stages  cannot be avoided and that the tenet of strict parallelism must be  rejected.}}

It also implies that, when an operator is for some reason assigned scope in an exceptional manner and escapes the usual syntactici restrictions on scope assignment, bound variable licensing will be exceptionally allowed as well.}}

It is argued here that the alleviation of Principle C violations ("antireconstruction effects"), where it occurs in A'-chains, is due not to deletion of hte lower copy, as in Chomsky 1995, but to vehicle change. The introduction of vehicle change into the theory of A'-chains is independently motivated as essential to capturing a robust adjunct/nonadjunct distinction in the reconstruction of pronoun-as-bound-variable readings that has not been discussed up to now; at the same time it predicts the class of "weakest crossover" environments.}}

Weight is described by each of the prenominal expressions in heavy rock, too much ballast, 2 pound rock, 2 pounds of rocks. The central claim of this paper is that the position of these types of expressions within the noun phrase limits the kinds of dimensions they may describe. The limitations have to do with whether or not the dimension tracks relevant part-whole relations. An analogy is made between these constraints and the well-known constraints on thematic relations that are incurred by the position of a noun phrase in a clause. A proposal is made about the meanings of expressions like too much and 2 pounds which explains their common cross-categorial distribution and this informs the analysis of their use in noun phrases. A position is taken on the meaning of the count mass distinction which, in conjunction with the hypothesis about dimensions, explains asymmetries in the distribution of prenominal adjectives with count and mass nouns.}}

It is claimed that the type of sentence which embeds the relative clause affects the binding options inside it. A relative clause formed of a chain that ends in a trace triggers functional/pair-list readings regardless of the type of sentence which embeds the relative clause. On the other hand, a relative clause formed of a chain that ends in a pronoun needs to be embedded in an equative sentence in order to trigger such readings. Theis effect is argued to follow from the constraints which govern resumptive pronouns, one of which being that they require salient discourse antecedents. It is also shown that previous analyses which attempt to derive the pronoun/trace alternation from syntactic principles alone fail to account for the equative/non-equative contrast.}}

The paper focuses on the Taiwanese element   kong (Mandarin shuo) `say' which is grammaticalizing as a complementizer-type particle   in an unexpected sentence-final position. Evidence from tone sandhi phenomena   indicates that this results from an operation of IP-raising in which the clausal com-   plement ofkongis raised to its left after the application of tone sandhi rules. The active   grammaticalization patterning offers both a clear insight into the creation of   clause/sentence-final particles in SVO languages and also provides strong evidence for   the idea of `cyclic Spell-Out'. It is also argued that a derivational rather than a purely   representational model of grammar is required to accommodate the patterns found.}}

However, some data turn out to be problematic for the traditional account. The alternative considered here involves pied-piping at an intermediate level between S-structure and LF. It is called WH-structure and is followed by reconstruction at LF. This proposal will combine the essential insights of Nishigauchi's idea and have all its advantages over the traditional view, without running into the problems of his approach.}}

In various modern Chinese dialects, the cognates of zhe, however, can also mark perfect, perfective, inchoative, and progressive aspects, as well as locative. By examining various uses of zhe's cognates in modern Chinese langauges and in historical texts, this paper finds that the imperfective zhe may arise from its uses as a directive verb in Middle Chinese. Furthermore, the imperfective and perfect aspects in Modern Wu are used interchangeably in situations related to resultative senses. It is further hypothesized that it is this type of sematnic overlapping that provides important links leading to the genesis of the various aspectual meanings of zhe's cognates. The paper concludes the genesis of the various aspectual meanings of zhe's cognates. The paper concludes that there are no clear-cut semantic boundaries among the Chinese apsectual categories.}}

These languages do not normally allow nominals  to occur without an article. However, some syntactic configurations, including predicative  constructions, supplementives and some prepositional phrases, allow bareness  of certain nominals. We argue that bare nominals in these constructions refer to  capacities: professions, religions, nationalities or other roles in society. Capacities are  analyzed as entities of type e, sortally distinct from regular individuals as well as kinds.  We further argue that the capacity interpretation is associated withNP---alayer within  theDP that lacks number features. This accounts for the number-neutral status of bare  nominals. We also show some patterns in languages other than Romance and Germanic  that provide further cross-linguistic support for the postulation of capacities as  a separate ontological category, specific to a low position within the DP.}}

Certain illicit cases of so-called remnant movement are accounted for itf the primitive operation inducing movement is feature movement and all category movement is feature-driven, as is claimed by the Attract/Move F hypothesis. Since the relevant cases of illicit remnant movement remain unaccounted for under the traditional Move alpha hypothesis, which claims that the primitive operation is category movement, the present discussion lends new empirical support to the feature-driven view of movement.}}

Two or more elements of a sentence, excluding the verb, can appear rather freely in   the focus position of Japanese cleft constructions. These elements cannot possibly   be considered to form a base-generated constituent and hence the existence of such   ``surprising constituents'' poses an interesting problem for syntactic theory. It is shown   that an approach that appeals to overt verb raising to account for surprising constituents   is inadequate for a number of reasons. An alternative approach is proposed in which   surprising constituents are formed by ``oblique movement'' (movement of an element   to another element that does not dominate it). Consequences of this proposal are   explored for related theoretical and empirical domains.}}

This paper proposes that sika-nai should be analyzed along the line of Watanabe (1991, 1992), who claims that Japanese has invisible syntactic wh-movement. We propose that sika has an invisible operator. Nai heads its own projection, NegP. The invisible operator moves to NegP-Spec in syntax. As evidence for this analysis, it will be demonstrated that sika-nai shows effect of the Subjacency Condition, The Proper Binding Condition, and the Linear Crossing Constraint. These principles interact with scrambling and wh-movement in such a way as to further confirm our analysis. We advance an argument against Chomsky's (1992) proposal that there is no S-structure condition.}}

The main distinction is made between those involvoing A-movement, like English passives, and those involving a null operator, like the tough-construction and the Complement Deletion Construction in English. The third type involves a lexical passive compound verb. Support for this claim comes from investigation of the facts regarding licensing of a post-verbal overt pronominal object, locality effects, the occurrence of the particle suo in the bei-construction, and the intervention of adverbs within the bei-V sequence. This article also shows the problems in previous analyses that derive the bei-construction from the same underlying structure.}}

This analysis will be shown to account for the various properties of \emph{suo}, including its surface ofer with respect to other elements in the clause, the complementary distribution between \emph{suo} and the resumptive pronoun \emph{ta} 'he', the "climbing" phenomenon, and the licesning asymmetry with respect to \emph{suo's} distribution, namely, the fact that \emph{suo} is allowed in locative inversion constructions but not in relativization of subject, manner and reason expressions.

This paper provides a solution for this mismatch by reanlyzing the pronouns with the unexpeced sloppy readings as E-type pronouns. Under the proposed analysis, the distribution of such pronouns is correctly predicted. It will also be shown that the analysis is successfully extended to sloppy indentity in association-with-focus cases.}}

Russian, along with many other   languages, has a construction that allows an overt specification of `others', the so-called   Plural Pronoun Construction (PPC), which involves a plural pronoun and a comitative   phrase. The syntactic behavior of this comitative phrase differs from that of other with-   phrases such as VP-adjuncts, NP-adjuncts, and comitative conjuncts. We will argue that   the syntactic behavior of the PPC-comitative follows from its syntactic status as a   complement of the plural pronoun D�. We will also suggest a formal semantic analysis of   PPC, where the comitative phrase is argued to supply the unsaturated element in the   interpretation of the plural pronoun.}}

The idea of coordinators as heads --   hence the CoP -- is endorsed, but not for initial coordinators; rather they figure in a   separate �distributive phrase�, which is transparently correlated to the (often   ambiguous) semantics of the construction. Furthermore, it is argued that the lack of   c-command between conjuncts is an instance of a broader effect, namely the   �invisibility� of paratactic material in general -- and of second conjuncts in particular.   Therefore, the grammar must have means to attach a paratactic constituent to the   rest of the structure in a way that will eventually block c-command relations from   the context. As this is not standardly available, we are led to define an operation   called b-Merge, which induces a special type of inclusion relation, �behindance�.   Thus, a modern revival of the 3D approach to coordination is brought about}}

This relationship is equally crucial to the phonological theory whether it is called 'phonemes and allophones', 'unerlying and surface forms', or 'input and output'. However, purely structural analyses of phonological systems can often produce several hypotheses regarding the phonemic inventory and its surface reflexes in any particular language, all of which are supportable by the contrast and alternation patterns of the languages. In this paper we look at four such hypotheses regarding the underlying vowel system of Mandarin, all based on Beijin Mandarin: the six-vowel system of c. Cheng (1973), the five-vowel systems of R. Cheng (1966) and of Lin(1989), and the four-vowel system of Wu (1994). We then present distributiona, phonetic, and psycholinguistic evdence (the latter based on a corpus of 238 syntagmatic speech errors or 'slips of the tongue' involving vowels) that the vowel system of the dialect of Mandarin currently spoken in Taiwan cannot be accounted for by any ofhtese hypotheses. We then propose a new 5-vowel system for Taiwan Mandarin, based ont eh distributional, phonetic, and especially the psycholinguistic facts. We conclude that phonological theories which are compatible with psycholinguistic evidence such as the data presented here are those most likely to be modeling the actual cognitive representations and processes of real speakers.}}

In a dialect of Yemeni Arabic, emphasis has two articulatory correlates, pharyngealization and labialization: within the phonological word, pharyngealization spreads predominantly leftward, and labialization spreads rightward, targeting short high vowels. Since asymmetries in the directionality of spread of a secondary feature are phonetically motivated and depend on whether the feature is anchored to the onset or the release phase of the primary articulation, it is arged that the unmarked directionality of spread should be encoded in the phonology as a markedness statement on that feature.}}

A new test is proposed for classifying the semantic number of predicates according to their behavior with singular/plural quantificational noun phrases such as every/all student(s) and no teache(s). Predicates that are (in)sensitive to such number variations are called atom/set predicates, respectively, and it is shown that this distinction cuts across the traditional distributive/collective typology.

Lexical Case is idiosyncratic   Case, lexically selected and licensed by certain lexical heads (certain   verbs and prepositions). Inherent Case is more regular, associated with   particular �-positions: inherent dative Case with DP goals, and ergative   Case with external arguments. Lexical and inherent Case turn out to   be in complementary distribution with respect to �-positions: only   themes/internal arguments may have lexical Case, and only external   arguments and DP goals may have inherent Case.

I show that we oserve the Chain Condition effect with the reflexive anaphor \emph{karezisin} 'himself' when the word order is that of direct object-indirect object but not vice versa, which supports the movement analysis of the word order alternation. It ahs been observed that we do not obtain the Chain condition effect with the reciprocal anaphor \emph{otagai} 'each other'. I argue that this observation follwos from the syntax and semantics of the reciprocal anaphor, and hence, does not constitute evidence against the movement analysis.}}

phrases in Amharic leaves a number of questions open. Foremost
among these is the placement of the linker element ya. Starting from
an analysis of relative clauses and possessors as predicates of their
``heads,'' this article develops a syntax of complex noun phrases in
Amharic that explains the raison d'etre and placement of ya, and also
accommodates facts about definiteness marking and agreement in the
Amharic complex noun phrase that have hitherto largely escaped attention
or analysis. The analysis emphasizes the role of Predicate Inversion
and head movement in syntax, and it confirms and extends the
minimalist Agree-and phase-based approach to syntactic relationships.}}

Aryan languages such as Hindi-Urdu and Bangla as SVO. We argue
against this position, drawing on rightward scrambling in Hindi-Urdu
to make this point. We propose an account of the phenomenon in
terms of rightward remnant-VP movement. This account differs from
proposals that posit rightward movement of individual arguments as
well as from the antisymmetric proposals mentioned above, which treat
rightward scrambling as argument stranding. Our rightward remnant
movement analysis better captures two empirical properties of rightward
scrambling that remain elusive in the other accounts: the correlation
between linear order and scope, and restricted scope for rightwardscrambled
wh-expressions.}}

	Title = {Issues in Banaw{\'a} Prosody: Onset Sensitivity, Minimal Words, and Syllable Integrity},
	Volume = {38},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {Three aspects of Banawa prosody (Buller, Buller, and Everett 1993,
Everett 1996a,b) have been argued to present significant difficulties
for metrical stress theory. First, Banawa stress is sensitive to the presence
or absence ofsyllable onsets; second, Banawa tolerates monomoraic
feet yet requires a bimoraic minimal word; and, third, it seems to
employ mora-based footing that is free to ignore syllable boundaries.
In this article, I argue that these issues are not nearly as problematic
as they might first appear. The article demonstrates that Banawa's
onset sensitivity can be produced by a constraint aligning the head
syllables off eet with onsets, that its minimal word restriction can be
produced with Nonfinality constraints, and that it can maintain syllable
integrity simply by giving clash and lapse avoidance priority over
other footing considerations.}}

	Volume = {38},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {As shown by Kayne (1975), Romance causatives with faire fall into
two classes, faire infinitif (FI) and faire par (FP). We argue from
Italian data that the properties of the two classes depend on the nature
of the complement of fare: FI embeds a vP, FP a nominalized VP. The
syntactic and semantic characteristics of these complements account
straightforwardly for well-known differences between FI and FP, including
the previously untreated ``obligation'' requirement in FI, absent
in FP. Our analysis also accounts for another subtle restriction
on the formation of FP: the existence of an animacy requirement on
the subject of fare, absent in FI. Finally, we argue that only FP can
undergo passivization; this accounts for a previously unobserved
asymmetry in passivizability of causatives of unergative and unaccusative
intransitive verbs.}}

	Volume = {25},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {This paper concentrates on the syntax and semantics of bare nominals in
Germanic and Romance languages. These languages do not normally allow nominals
to occur without an article. However, some syntactic configurations, including predicative
constructions, supplementives and some prepositional phrases, allow bareness
of certain nominals. We argue that bare nominals in these constructions refer to
capacities: professions, religions, nationalities or other roles in society. Capacities are
analyzed as entities of type e, sortally distinct from regular individuals as well as kinds.
We further argue that the capacity interpretation is associated withNP---alayer within
theDP that lacks number features. This accounts for the number-neutral status of bare
nominals. We also show some patterns in languages other than Romance and Germanic
that provide further cross-linguistic support for the postulation of capacities as
a separate ontological category, specific to a low position within the DP.}}

	Title = {The Origin of Vowel Length Neutralization in Final Position: Evidence from {F}innish Speakers},
	Volume = {25},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {In a broad variety of languages with contrastive vowel length,
long vowels are systematically excluded from a domain-final position, and are
replaced with short vowels there. This is despite the fact that vowels at the
end of a domain (utterance, phrase, word) are generally longer in duration
than corresponding nonfinal vowels. We propose that the phonological pattern
of final shortening arises diachronically from the effects of final devoicing -- the
breakdown in voicing at the end of an utterance. Partial devoicing of the final
vowel makes it difficult to hear the end of the vowel and so favors identification
of final vowels as short. If language learners generalize such an identification
pattern, they have adopted a final shortening pattern. The claim that partially
voiceless final vowels tend to be identified as short is supported by a series of
experiments with Finnish speakers. The first two experiments establish that there
is both final lengthening and final devoicing in the language. Three further experiments
show that Finnish speakers identify the length category of partially voiceless
final vowels on the basis of the duration of its voiced portion, so that partial
devoicing of a vowel increases the probability of its being identified as short.}}

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe and analyse a particular scope marking
construction that has not received attention in the generative literature so far: scope
marking into relative and noun-associate clauses, which we will refer to as adjunct
scope marking. In this type of scope marking system, a wh-element in an embedded adjunct
clause takes matrix scope when it occurs in a clause that syntactically and semantically
modifies a wh-phrase in the matrix. These facts provide unambiguous evidence
for the indirect dependency approach to wh-scope marking advocated by Dayal (1994,
2000) where the embedded question provides a semantic restriction for thematrix whelement.
Dayal's theory will be extended to provide a compositional analysis of these
constructions. The extended approach argues for a generalization of the question-formation
procedure to different clause types, as first advocated in Sternefeld (2001).}}

	Volume = {25},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {Bidirectional case markers in West African languages, including those of
the Songhay family, are morphemes inserted between subject and object NPs that
would otherwise be adjacent. They therefore specify both that the NP to the left is
a subject, and that the NP to the right is an object, and they cannot be bracketed
uniquely with either. This is shown by the fact that these morphemes are absent when
either subject or object position is (structurally and phonologically) absent, for example
due to extraction. This is the only morphological case-marking in the relevant
languages. The operation inserting such morphemes must have reference to constituent
structure (NP), abstract case (subject, object), and linear adjacency. These data
increase the evidence that complex case-marking operations can apply in a centrally
located morphology component that has simultaneous access to categorial and linear
relations. The idea is questionable that such morphological operations take place at a
syntax/PF interface, where syntactic categories are first aligned with prosodic phrases,
since actual prosodic (e.g. accentual) bracketings do not always coincide with the
bracketings relevant to case morphology. This point is made with data from Tamashek
(Berber) nominal prefix alternations, preceding the main section on Songhay
case marking.}}

	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {This paper explores the role that the scalar properties and presuppositions
of even play in creating polarity sensitive even meanings crosslinguistically (henceforth
EVEN). I discuss the behavior of three lexically distinct Greek counterparts
of even in positive, negative, subjunctive sentences, and polar questions. These items
are shown to be polarity sensitive, and a three-way distinction is posited between a
positive polarity (akomi ke), a negative polarity (oute), and a `flexible scale'even (esto)
which does not introduce likelihood, but is associated with scales made salient by the
context. The analysis is a refinement of Rooth's original idea that negative polarity
is involved in the interpretation of English even, and establishes further that the
``negative'' polarity domain of EVEN includes a sensitivity that is not strictly speaking
negative (flexible scale esto). The distributional restrictions of EVEN items are shown
to follow from distinct presuppositions (positive polarity and flexible scale EVEN),
or from their lexical featural specification (negative polarity EVEN), a result that
squares neatly with the fact that ill-formedness is systematic pragmatic deviance in
the former case but robust ungrammaticality in the latter. This result supports the by
now widely accepted view that polarity dependencies are not of uniform nature, and
that we need to distinguish presupposition failures (which are weaker and possibly
fixable in some contexts) from cases of ungrammaticality which are robust and cannot
be fixed in any context (Giannakidou, 2001).}}

	Volume = {25},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {A number of interactions in grammar are referred to as showing blocking
effects, typically defined as cases in which the existence of one form prevents the
existence of a form that is otherwise expected to occur. Patterns of analytic/synthetic
alternation, in which two-word and one-word forms alternate with each other, have
been taken to be instances of blocking in this sense. An example is found in the formation
of English comparatives and superlatives, where, for example, the synthetic form
smarter appears to block the analytic form *more smart. Analytic forms are available
in other cases (e.g. more intelligent), such that the interaction between the ``one word''
and ``two word'' forms is crucially at issue. This paper examines English comparative
and superlative formation, concentrating on the question of how the morphophonology
relates to syntax and semantics. A central point is that in the architecture of
Distributed Morphology, these cases do not involve word/word or word/phrase competition-
based blocking. Rather, blocking effects broadly construed are reduced to the
effects of distinct mechanisms: (1) Vocabulary Insertion at a particular terminal node
(morpheme), and (2) the operation of combinatory processes. The paper provides
a detailed discussion of the latter type, showing that synthetic comparative/superlative
forms are created post-syntactically by affixation under adjacency. Throughout
the discussion, questions concerning the status of blocking effects in Distributed Morphology, and those
found in analytic/synthetic alternations in particular, play a central role.}}

adjuncts in the form of Huang's (1982) Condition on Extraction Domains (CED) and
Chomsky's (1986a) Barriers and its minimalist descendants face an empirical challenge
presented by languages in which extraction out of subjects is possible but extraction out
of adjuncts is not. The existence of such languages calls into question the unifying basis
for the traditional accounts---namely, the complement/noncomplement distinction that
was at the core of these accounts. In this paper I consider a possible extension of a
recent minimalist account making use of the complement/noncomplement distinction---
Nunes and Uriagereka (2000)---to the problematic languages and show that it
also encounters conceptual and empirical problems. I then propose an   eclectic   minimalist
approach to extraction domains in which extractability out of subjects and adjuncts
are regulated by different mechanisms of grammar in a nonoverlapping manner.}}

matters; second, the relevant clauses are obligatorily parsed as separate intonational
phrases. I show that these properties lead to a new generalization that can be derived
from independent assumptions about the syntax-phonology interface, according to
which an intonational phrase whose boundary cannot be properly demarcated is
disallowed in PF. I argue that this is exactly why null complementizer clauses are ruled
out in certain syntactic positions. I also discuss a parallelism between intonational
phrases and the notion of phase proposed by Chomsky (2000, 2001).}}

	Volume = {11},
	Year = {2002},
	Abstract = {In Standard Mandarin, a mid vowel agrees in [back] and [round] features with adjacent 
glides. A mid vowel preceded by a front rounded glide [ h], however, is only partially assimilated, resulting in a front unrounded [e] rather than the expected front rounded [o/]. This process of Mid Vowel Assimilation varies across Mandarin dialects depending on the features involved, the direction of feature spreading, and whether 
or not a mid vowel is fully or partially assimilated. This article proposes a unified 
constraint-based account of the variation and typology of Mid Vowel Assimilation 
across Mandarin dialects. Couched within Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 
1993) and Feature Class Theory (Padgett 1995, 1996), the proposed analysis demon- 
strates (i) how the interaction of gradient assimilation-related constraints and 
markedness constraints on feature cooccurrence avoids marked segment types and 
produces partial assimilation effects, and (ii) how different rankings of the proposed 
set of constraints generate the variation pattern across Mandarin dialects. To fully 
account for the typology of Mandarin Mid Vowel Assimilation and the uneven dis- 
tribution of different types of Mid Vowel Assimilation, I suggest that (i) some 
assimilation-related constraints can be categorically assessed as a marked option, 
and (ii) some constraint rankings on markedness, while not universally fixed, can be 
designated as universal default rankings.}}

	Year = {2002},
	Abstract = {This paper aims to give an explicit categorial syntax and formal semantics of various 
forms of floating quantifiers (FQs) in Korean. Non-case-marked FQs are assigned 
the category of NP modifier, i.e., NP\NP and this categorization, together with the 
combinatorial operation of functional composition, can handle the basic cases of 
subject/object asymmetry. An FQ in front of a transitive verb can compose with the 
verb, making itself related only to the object, but not to the subject. Case-marked 
FQs show no such asymmetry and they can be handled when they are assigned cat- 
egories of VP or TV modifiers. 
Discourse factors are also relevant for FQs particularly because FQs with discourse 
markers, which signify some discourse-relevant prominence, enjoy the full freedom 
of word order as usual adverbs. Non-case-marked FQs can also be used as adver- 
bials in a strong discourse context such as a ``contrastive'' one or nonconstituent 
coordination construction, but discourse effects are not as strong in Korean as in 
Japanese, as shown by still-awkward sentences with topicalized FQs. The absence 
of discourse restriction of contrastiveness with respect to dative NP hosts is another 
indication that Korean FQs are less affected by discourse factors than Japanese ones. 
Discourse factors are more grammaticalized in Korean than in Japanese.}}

-- but the chronological proximity of these two works makes this consensus difficult

of Man'y{\^o}sh{\^u}, to demonstrate that a careful screening of these data reveals vestiges 
of the orthographic tradition preserved in Kojiki in other records as well. The begin-

Two or more elements of a sentence, excluding the verb, can appear rather freely in 
the focus position of Japanese cleft constructions. These elements cannot possibly 
be considered to form a base-generated constituent and hence the existence of such 
``surprising constituents'' poses an interesting problem for syntactic theory. It is shown 
that an approach that appeals to overt verb raising to account for surprising constituents 
is inadequate for a number of reasons. An alternative approach is proposed in which 
surprising constituents are formed by ``oblique movement'' (movement of an element 
to another element that does not dominate it). Consequences of this proposal are 
explored for related theoretical and empirical domains.}}

	Volume = {11},
	Year = {2002},
	Abstract = {The Old Japanese modal suffix beshi deserves special attention for at least two reasons. 
Firstly, it is one of only a few modal markers throughout Japanese language history 
that have both deontic and epistemic meaning, which is very common in English 
and other Indo-European languages. Secondly, it is said to be extremely polysemous. 
There might be no other modal suffix in the history of the Japanese language that 
has been associated with such a range and variety of meanings. There are also concrete 
examples of beshi that are given divergent interpretations in grammatical analysis 
and Modern Japanese translations. 
The primary goal of this paper is to provide a principled explanation both for 
the different ``meanings'' of beshi and for divergent interpretations that are due to 
indeterminacy. It is argued that Old Japanese beshi from a synchronic point of view 
basically has only a deontic and an epistemic sense, and other ``meanings'' can be 
explained either in terms of vagueness or in terms of implicature in specific contexts. 
Conditions are explained under which indeterminacy between the deontic and the 
epistemic sense arises and compared with the conditions for indeterminacy and 
deontic-epistemic polysemy to those observed in the history of modals in English 
and German. Furthermore an account of the diachronic layering behind the syn- 
chronic meaning range of beshi in Old Japanese is given. It is claimed that the 
development of the meanings of beshi does not strictly adhere to the ``deontic-to- 
epistemic'' pattern frequently found on Indo-European languages.}}

kong (Mandarin shuo) `say' which is grammaticalizing as a complementizer-type particle 
in an unexpected sentence-final position. Evidence from tone sandhi phenomena 
indicates that this results from an operation of IP-raising in which the clausal com- 
plement ofkongis raised to its left after the application of tone sandhi rules. The active 
grammaticalization patterning offers both a clear insight into the creation of 
clause/sentence-final particles in SVO languages and also provides strong evidence for 
the idea of `cyclic Spell-Out'. It is also argued that a derivational rather than a purely 
representational model of grammar is required to accommodate the patterns found.}}

cant extent on which speech act those sentences are used to perform. In an Austinian 
theory of assertive speech acts, four types of assertive speech act are distinguished. 
It is argued here that the dimensions along which the structures of these speech acts 
vary are the dimensions that serve to explain the presence of -wa. Furthermore, the 
various uses of -wathat have been identified in the literature, including the thematic 
and contrastive uses, are brought under a unified system. There are, however, two more 
general themes that are addressed here. First, it is claimed that, once a principled theory 
of speech acts is in play, the relative contributions of syntax and semantics to the study 
of natural language become more easy to distinguish. This provides an antidote to 
the tendency to syntacticize problems that are properly pragmatic (or pragmaticize 
problems that are properly syntactic, etc.). The attempt is made to separate these 
domains without favor. The other theme involves Austin's account of predication in 
terms of matching types of items and senses of predicates. That proposal, which 
stands in contrast to common assumptions in the semantics literature, and which is 
central to his account of assertive speech acts, deserves attention}}

languages of all possible types are attested: most crucially,
wh-in-situ languages without question particles exist, and wh-in-situ
languages that do not use wh-words as indefinites also exist. In fact,
most languages, regardless of whether they are wh-movement or whin-

In contrast, the Clements-Hume model appears to be able to achieve
the same goal without recourse to derivational stages because it is
based on the assumption that, in the ways relevant for palatalization,
vowels and consonants are characterized by the same features. However,
analysis of palatalization and related processes shows that this
assumption is incorrect. The consequence is that derivational stages
cannot be avoided and that the tenet of strict parallelism must be
rejected.}}

provide evidence regarding the height of the verb. Even so, such facts
are rare, especially in the input to children, and so we might expect
that not all speakers exposed to a head-final language acquire the same
grammar as far as V-raising is concerned. Here, we present evidence
supporting this expectation. Using experimental data concerning the
scope of quantified NPs and negation in Korean, elicited from both
adults and 4-year-old children, we show that there are two populations
of Korean speakers: one with V-raising and one without.}}

cases, a plural adjective is required with coordinated singular nouns, while in other cases that
seemto be syntactically identical, a plural adjective is disallowed. The key to this puzzle lies at
the syntax-semantics interface: plural adjectives are required in cases of NATURAL COORDINATION,
where a salient close relation holds between the conjuncts, but disallowed in cases of ACCIDENTAL
COORDINATION. The semantic distinction between natural and accidental coordination has a syntactic
reflex in Finnish, where only the features of the natural-coordination structure are compatible
with the agreement requirements of plural adjectives. We show that the distinction between natural
and accidental coordination is syntactically reflected not only in Finnish, but in other languages
as well, including Tundra Nenets, Russian, and Kurdish.*}}

combination with an additional licit gap, a result that has interesting implications for theories of
grammar. Such constructions hold even greater interest for the question of the relation between
grammatical knowledge and real-time language processing. This article presents results from two
experiments on parasitic-gap constructions in English in which the parasitic gap appears inside
a subject island, before the licensing gap. An off-line studyconfirms that parasitic gaps are
acceptable when theyoccur inside the infinitival complement of a subject NP, but not when they
occur inside a finite relative clause. An on-line self-paced reading studyusing a plausibility
manipulation technique shows that incremental positing of gaps inside islands occurs in just those
environments where parasitic gaps are acceptable. The fact that parasitic gaps are constructed
incrementallyin language processing presents a challenge for attempts to explain subject islands
as epiphenomena of constraints on language processing and also helps to resolve apparent conflicts
in previous studies of the role of island constraints in parsing.*}}

than they might appear at first glance. The evidence for the nonconstituency of the verb and its
original arguments inpreposed position comes from its solution to what has been termed Pesetsky's
paradox, in that an object of a preposed VP can bind into an adverbial at the end of a sentence,
creating an apparent conflict between the assumptions that binding requires c-command and that
only constituents move. This article also provides evidence for c-command as the prominence

grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of
categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances

an Austronesian language. Our study is based on the longitudinal data of three children
ages 19--32 months, and is to our knowledge the first systematic investigation
of the acquisition of Malagasy. The Malagasy voicing system has a distinctive morphology
and involves the promotion of an argument (actor, theme, instrument, etc.)
to a referentially and syntactically prominent position, typically clause-final.We look
at two competing accounts of the Malagasy voicing system, one in which the promoted
argument is analyzed as a subject and the promotion operation an instance of
A-movement (Guilfoyle, Hung, & Travis, 1992) and a more recent account in which
Malagasy is analyzed as a V2-like language in which the promoted argument is a topic
and the promotion an instance of A -movement (Pearson, M. (2001); Pearson, M. (2005)). 
Both analyses have clear implications for acquisition, which we examine in
this paper. Our acquisition results favor the analysis of the promoted argument as
an A -element. We also show that there is a developmental stage in Malagasy that
parallels the root infinitive (RI) stage widely observed in various European languages.
Apparent differences between the Germanic RIs and the analogous phenomenon in
Malagasy are derived from differences in the functional structure associated with a
voicing system as opposed to an agreement system.}}

typologically unrelated languages, Italian and Chinese, and shows that in spite of the
superficial differences they are ruled by the same grammatical principles. It is proposed
that the properties determining the temporal location of events at the interface
level --- i.e., Sequence of Tense --- also allow the identification of the antecedent of
long distance anaphors. The paper focuses on so-called blocking effects---namely, the
impossibility for a long distance anaphor to extend its binding domain beyond certain
elements, such as an indicative verbal form in Italian or an indexical or context-related
item in Chinese. I also consider backward binding phenomena, and show how they
might follow from the same generalizations. The paper investigates the role of the
speaker and the bearer of attitude in the sentence, and capitalizing on the proposals by
Giorgi and Pianesi (1997, 2001a, 2001b, 2004a, 2004b) on Sequence of Tense, argues
that they are syntactically realized and might act as binders and blockers both for

	Abstract = {Modern Hebrew differentiates between definite and indefinite objects,
using a prepositional object marker only in front of definites. This article explores the
hypothesis that lack of an object marker when the object is indefinite follows from
lack of abstract Case on indefinite objects. It is shown that indefinites in Hebrew are
allowed in various other positions in which Case seems to be unavailable and in which
definites are not allowed, a fact that receives a straightforward account under the
proposed hypothesis that indefinites do not require Case. The possibility of having
Caseless indefinites is then argued to follow from lack of a DP projection in Hebrew
indefinites. The second part of this article aims to show that an analysis of indefinites
in Hebrew as lacking a DP projection is indeed possible and can be motivated
on independent grounds. This involves a reexamination of the arguments that have
motivated the influential N-to-D analysis of Semitic noun phrases. I claim that most
previous work on Semitic nominals is in fact compatible with an analysis in which
nouns do not raise as high as the D position, and that the hypothesis that indefinites
in Hebrew are not full DPs has some explanatory advantages over the view that all
construct state nominals in Hebrew are DPs.}}

for Hindi by Dayal (Locality in WH quantification: Questions and relative
clauses in Hindi. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996). On the semantic
side, we argue however that unlike Hindi correlatives, PROREL clauses lack restrictive
interpretations and are interpreted instead as subject-predicate structures. In
this respect, they are similar to Japanese internally headed relative clauses (IHRCs)
investigated by Shimoyama (Journal of East Asian Linguistics 8:147--182, 1999). We
propose that like Japanese IHRCs in Shimoyama's proposal, PROREL clauses are
related to the main clause via e-type anaphora.}}

studied independently of each other. This paper examines two phonological
processes that simultaneously exhibit both phenomena: Assibilation and Apocope
in Finnish. The evidence converges on two main conclusions. First, variation
results from the presence of MULTIPLE METRICAL SYSTEMS within Finnish. Assibilation
and Apocope are metrically conditioned alternations and the segmental
variation reflects metrical variation. The metrical analysis explains a number of
apparently unrelated phenomena, including typological asymmetries across dialects,
quantitative asymmetries within dialects, differences between nouns and
verbs, differences among noun classes, and the loci of lexical frequency effects.
Second, phonological opacity arises from MORPHOLOGICAL LEVEL ORDERING. By
interleaving transparent phonologies with independently motivated morphosyntactic
constituents (stems, words, phrases) we derive the transparent and opaque
interactions of four phonological processes, including Assibilation and Apocope.}}

The amount of material copied varies between a single C (mavit / ma-m-vit
`lion(s)') and CV (hodai / ho-ho-dai `rock(s)'). The former is preferred unless copying
a single C would give rise to an illicit coda or cluster, in which case CV is copied. In
contrast to previous analyses of similar patterns in Tohono O'odham and Lushootseed,
I analyze the reduplicant as an infix rather than a prefix. The infixation of the
reduplicant can be generated via constraints requiring the first vowel of the stem to
correspond to the first vowel of the word. Furthermore, the preference for copying the
initial consonant of the word can be generated by extending positional faithfulness
to the base-reduplicant relationship. I argue that the infixation analysis is superior
on two grounds. First, it reduces the C vs. CV variation to an instance of reduplicant
size conditioned by phonotactics. Second, unlike the prefixation analyses, which must
introduce a new notion of faithfulness to allow syncope in the base just in the context
of reduplication (e.g. ``existential faithfulness'' (Struijke 2000a)), the infixation
analysis uses only independently necessary constraints of Correspondence Theory.}}

underlying (i.e. nonderived) /XY/ sequences are permitted to surface as [XY]. It

	Abstract = {The Cantonese `coverb' construction, a serial verb construction in
which the first verb (the `coverb') has a preposition-like meaning and function,
presents a challenge for theories of wh-dependencies and island constraints. Coverbs
resist extraction of their objects by topicalization or relativization, a fact
which has often been explained in terms of a preposition-stranding constraint in
accounts of similar facts in Mandarin. However, Cantonese coverbs display the
morphosyntactic properties of verbs, suggesting that they cannot be prepositions.
In this paper, we propose that coverbs are verbs, and that the relevant extraction
constraint is a kind of adjunct island constraint. This proposal is supported
with experimental evidence from a sentence judgment task. Two key findings are
as follows: (1) listeners judged extraction from a coverb phrase as significantly
less acceptable than extraction from a simple clause; (2) listeners judged sentences
both with and without aspectual marking (verbal morphosyntax) on the
coverb as highly acceptable. Together, these findings support our proposal that
coverbs are verbs (not prepositions) and that coverb phrases form a kind of
adjunct island. However, we show that existing adjunct island conditions (such as
the CED) are not adequate to account for our data. Following Hawkins' (1999)
processing-based theory of filler-gap dependencies, we propose a simple, languagespecific
formulation of the extraction constraint, and we argue that this constraint
is more generally motivated by a processing principle called Avoid Competing
Subcategorizers -- one of the same principles that motivates preposition-stranding
constraints in other languages. Thus, although object extraction is prohibited by
a kind of adjunct island constraint, the function of the constraint in processing
efficiency is similar to that of a preposition-stranding constraint.}}

the `either too high' puzzle (either can be dissociated from the contrastive focus,

(either is apparently too low in the tree, embedded inside the first disjunct). Covering
data beyond the range of extant accounts, this paper presents an integrated solution
to both puzzles. The paper's central claim is that both either and or are phrasal
categories. They originate in a position adjoined to their disjunct, to the contrastive
focus or to a higher node on the `h-path' projected from the contrastive focus.
Though either itself is immobile, its [+NEG] counterpart, neither, can undergo
phrasal movement from its base-generation site to a higher position in the tree, from
which it triggers negative inversion; [+WH] whether must move to SpecCP; and or
and [+NEG] nor must, if they are not base-generated there, front to the initial
position in the second disjunct in order to be able to participate in a feature-checking
relationship with the abstract head J(unction), the functional head that takes the
second disjunct as its complement and the first disjunct as its specifier. The movement

Trinidad Dialectal English (TDE), spoken on the Eastern Caribbean island of
Trinidad. The examination of the PC in TDE is of typological interest inasmuch
as it resembles similar constructions in certain West African languages. A PC
renders focus or contrastive focus to a verb in a given sentence by copying the
verb and preposing it. Similar verb focusing constructions have been observed for
many West African languages, including Vata and Nweh, as well as for Caribbean
Creoles (Koopman 1984, Piou 1982). The PC in TDE is also of theoretical
interest when combined with wh-question formation; the wh-subject/object asymmetries
explored here provide interesting support for an escape hatch for whphrases
in an intermediate position between VP and Tense that is comparable to
a VP-adjoined position (Chomsky 1986). Evidence is also provided for a CP-like
domain lower in the clause; I argue that both a wh-phrase and a verb focused
in a PC have focus features that must be checked in a Focus Phrase (FocP). The
current investigation enriches the characterization of both PCs and wh-question
formation by looking not only at each operation individually but also examining
their interaction with one another as well as with adverbs.}}

	Volume = {9},

	Abstract = {The German POSSESSOR DATIVE CONSTRUCTION (PDC) is an instance of
EXTERNAL POSSESSION: a single nominal acts simultaneously as possessor, that is,
a subpart of a larger nominal phrase, and as a BENEFACTIVE or MALEFACTIVE
(AFFECTEE) argument of the verb. The challenge is to understand the mechanisms
that make this dual functioning possible. Following Landau [Lingua 107 (1999) 1],
this paper presents a POSSESSOR RAISING analysis, arguing that the POSSESSOR DATIVE
(PD) moves from the specifier of the possessed nominal to a verbal argument
position. The analysis is implemented in a dynamic structure-building framework,
where heads with their selectional features are introduced in the course of the
derivation, and it is in principle possible that an argument that gets merged into the
structure to take on one thematic role raises into a newly built sentence domain to
fulfill another thematic role. This movement and the resulting double h-role
assignment are crucially driven by formal features; that is, both stem from the fact
that, in its origin site, the raised argument is not case-licensed. An additional caselicensing
head is needed for the derivation to converge. This head is an affectee light
verb which assigns inherent dative case to the argument in its specifier. Thus, unlike
Landau's account of PDCs in Hebrew, where PDs can be interpreted as affected without actually being h-related to the verb, the analysis here offers an explanation
for the crosslinguistically more general case of the PDC, where the PD's role as both
possessor and affectee needs to be syntactically encoded.}}

clitic inversion and main wh-questions introduced by the
complementizer che (wh+che). Parry (1998a) takes these structures to be in
complementary distribution, claiming that che preempts V-to-C movement in
interrogative inversion and destroys the licensing environment for interrogative
clitics. In this paper, I argue for the revision of this claim. Building on Chomsky's
(1995) checking theory, I propose an analysis of Piedmontese interrogatives in the
spirit of Roberts and Roussou's (1999) dissociation of features [wh] and [Q]. I
maintain that interrogative V-to-C movement and matrix wh+che questions target
different CPs, hence the verb in C and che do not compete for the same position.
Factors other than syntactic ones are responsible for the rare use of interrogative clitics
in wh+che structures. The analysis presented in this paper supports the complexity of
the Left Periphery proposed by Rizzi (1997).}}

people process this type of complex ``restructured'' predicate in real
time. Because of the properties of the V-te V predicate, it was possible
to compare restructured predicates with nonrestructured ones, keeping
such factors as event composition, Case licensing, and lexical choice
constant. The results of the experiment suggest that the tested restructured
predicates involve a single array of predicate-argument association
rather than two separate arrays, even though they contain two
verbs. The results also revealed that syntactically complex ditransitive
predicates are processed with the same ease as lexical ditransitives.}}

Furthermore, we show that a primitive c-command view of syntactic structure provides the basis for a radically simplified conception of adjunction structure, one that not only allows us to understand why the adjuncitons operation exists alongside subsitition, but also explain why these operations have their distinctive structural and derivational properties.}}

It comprises the case forms used to spell out nominals that do not receive a case specification by assignment or other syntactic means. As such, it does not interact with the Case Filter, which is argued to be a purely syntactic constraint as opposed to a morphophonological one. It is shown that diverse phenomena in the distribution of pronouns in English can be parsimoniously treated using default case, and further that English can thereby be assimilated to ``richer'' case languages such as German, rather than being analyzed with arbitrary language-particular rules. A sampling of phenomena from other languages demonstrates that evidence for default case is widespread, and moreover, that crosslinguistic differences in case patterns can often be reduced to the choice of a default case.}}

As far as I can see, there can be three types of counterexamples to Progovac: (i) noncorrelative constructions necessarily involving multiple-event interpretations (with no independent factor excluding single-event interpretations); (11) correlative coordination involving single-event interpretations; and (iii) pairs in which noncorrelative coordination permits multiple-event interpretation but the correlative couterparts only have single-event interpretation. The alleged counterexamples offered in Tsohatzidis are only of types (i) and (ii). On closer inspection, it turns out that the alleged type (i) counterexamples are not true counterexamples because they involve an independent factor, and that the alleged type (ii) counterexamples can be analyzed as involving multiple events. Tsohatzidis's attempt to dispute the claim in Progovac thus fails.}}

The latter takes a smaller sized complement (in terms of the presence of functional structure), has a perceptual rather than epistemic interpretation, and imposes a scalarity-related restriction on it complement, which will be formalized as a selectional requirement of a DegP complement. The notion of scalarity, heretofore applicable only to adjectives, is extended to PPs, such as "out of her mind," and nouns, such as "fool." DegP is projected either if a predicate is scalar (has a degree argument slot) or to function as a landing site for QR of degree, which will be shown to function as the licensing mechanism for complements of "seem."}}

effects follow from independent mechanisms of the grammar. EPP effects concerning
the final landing site of A-movement follow from Case theory. Intermediate
[Spec,IP]s are filled as a result of the requirement of successive cyclicity (i.e.,
locality); otherwise they remain empty, which is unexpected if the EPP were to hold.
In particular, intermediate [Spec,IP]s remain empty in constructions involving
expletive subjects, which I argue do not move at all. It is also argued that the
requirement of successive cyclicity should not be tied to a property of intermediate
heads, as in the feature-checking/filled-specifier requirement approach to successive
cyclicity, but to a property of the movement itself.}}

for certain interpretational facts about the construction, does not provide an analysis
of the word-order facts. Second, the overt raising account, which can account
for the word order facts, still faces two main challenges; there remain important
open questions about verb placement, and though none of the current approaches
to extraction can easily explain it, extraction and raising-to-object interact in
complex ways that are still not well understood. Third, the movement theory of
control, which treats object control in a way parallel to overt raising-to-object,
faces not only the challenges to the overt raising account, but several others
particular to object control. Finally, the article describes the HPSG analysis of
raising-to-object, which can account straightforwardly for the word order facts, and
with the appropriate constraints can be extended to account for the extraction facts
discussed.}}

	Abstract = {This paper presents unusual patterns in raising and control and offers a
syntactic account which would validate such patterns. On the empirical side, we present
evidence for backward control (data from several languages), backward raising (in
Adyghe), copy control (Zapotec, Assamese, Tongan) and copy raising (data from a
number of languages). All the unusual cases of raising and control seem to involve an
A-movement chain in which the lower, not the higher copy is pronounced, or both
copies are spelled out. We also review some constructions which, while superficially
resembling backward or copy structure, do not provide any evidence for a movement
chain. On the theoretical side, assuming that the more unusual patterns are an empirical
reality, linguistic theory should be capable of analyzing them. We present mechanisms
from the current Minimalist Program which we believe allow the attested variation.}}

	Volume = {9},
	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {Deriving the distribution of PRO in a principled manner is a central task
for the theory of control. Traditionally, Case has been identified as the key to this
problem: PRO was argued to bear no Case at all, or some special (  null  ) Case. I argue
that PRO bears standard case like normal lexical DPs; clear evidence comes from
languages with case-concord (Russian, Hungarian, Icelandic). Moreover, PRO (and
obligatory control) may occur in finite clauses (Hebrew, Balkan languages).
Conclusion: PRO's distribution must be completely divorced from Case, possibly
because abstract Case does not exist. The alternative is to tie the distribution of PRO
to the specific values of [T] and [Agr] on the I0 and C0 heads of the embedded
clause (Landau 2004). A feature-based algorithm predicts the distribution of PRO in a
variety of clausal complements. It is shown that the system naturally explains some
intriguing correlations between obligatory control and agreement in Basque and Welsh
complementation structures.}}

	Volume = {9},
	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {Historically, control in generative grammar has fallen within the province of
syntactic theory. One primary reason for this is that Mainstream Generative Grammar
(MGG) has imposed a strong uniformity criterion on analyses as a measure of their
explanatory adequacy. One aspect of this uniformity criterion, which we call Interface
Uniformity, holds that the syntax-semantics interface is maximally simple, in that meaning
maps transparently into syntactic structure, and that it is maximally uniform, so that the
same meaning always maps into the same syntactic structure. It follows from Interface
Uniformity that a nonfinite VP has a syntactic subject that is assigned its external h-role.
We argue that this view is most sustainable if one does not take into account the full richness
and complexity of control phenomena, but treats control strictly in terms of complementation.
When a fuller range of phenomena is taken into account, it appears that it is preferable to
``turn over control'' to the semantics, which is better equipped to capture the facts.We outline
how to formulate the syntax-semantics interface so as to get the semantic facts to line up
properly with the syntactic facts. This analysis of the interface extends naturally to raising.}}

is a subspecies of movement. That is, control is just like familiar instances of raising,

which are examined here.}}

Studies 1 and 2 show that ambiguous negative quantified sentences of the sort typically used in acquisition studies are strongly avoided in adult production and are judged as poor alternatives by adults. Corpus studies 3 and 4 show that children and adults overwhelmingly use quantifiers and negation in ways that promote one interpretation of these ambiguous quantified sentences over others. We argue that these patterns guide children's ambiguity reolution processes and explain children's interpretations of ambiguous quantified sentences. The origin of distributional patterns in adult production processes is discussed.}}

On the other hand, indefinite subjects tend to be interpreted referentially in most contexts, even in contexts where adults would favor a nonreferential reading. In this article we offer an explanation for this pattern within the framework of bidrectional Optimality Theory. This explanation focuses on clarifyng in what sense children's interpretations deviate from the adult interpretations and clarifying the nature of the linguistic knowledge that the 4-year-old child will need to acquire to become a competent, adultlike speaker and hearer of her language.}}

In this article, we present experimental evidence from children learning English and Kannada demonstrating that children's indefinites show scopal restrictions parallel to the restrictions they show with other unambiguously quantificational expressions. Children, unlike adults, show a strong preference to assign quantificational expressions surface scope. This is true for both strong and weak quantifiers, which would be surprising on a theory of indefinites that treated these expressions as uniformly nonquantificational. Consequently, we argue that in adult grammars indefinites must have a quantificational representation at least some of the time.}}

of a small, but well-explored, area of English: the contraction of want to to wanna. It
distinguishes three general approaches to the analysis of wanna: a phonological rule, lexicalization,
or a derivational rule. Each approach has a different set of strengths, but they all have weaknesses
as well. The article then offers a new analysis in terms of REALIZATION, which combines the
strengths of all the previous analyses. This analysis, which is based on the theory of word grammar,
accounts not only for all the well-known syntactic and morphological constraints on this contraction,
but also for a fact that has not been noted before: that, for some speakers, the last vowel
alternates in just the same idiosyncratic way as that of to, which suggests strongly that in some
sense wanna contains to as well as want. For these (but not all) speakers, the proposed analysis
recognizes two words (sublexemes of WANT and TOinf) at the level of syntax and a single form
( wanna , containing variants of  want  and  to ) at the level of form; the relations between these
words and forms, and between the forms and their phonological realizations, are defined by a
declarative network.}}

	Year = {2006},
	Abstract = {The main focus of this article is the occurrence of some polarity items (PIs) in the complements
of emotive factive verbs and only. This fact has been taken as a challenge to the semantic approach
to PIs (Linebarger 1980), because only and factive verbs are not downward entailing (DE). A
modification of the classical DE account is proposed by introducing the notion of nonveridicality
(Zwarts 1995, Giannakidou 1998, 1999, 2001) as the one crucial for PI sanctioning. To motivate
this move, it is first shown that two solutions in the direction of weakening classical monotonicity
do not work: Strawson DE (von Fintel 1999) and weak DE (Hoeksema 1986). Weakening DE
systematically either overgenerates or undergenerates, in either case failing to characterize the
correct set of licensers. Nonveridicality is introduced as a conservative extension of DE and is
shown to account for PIs also in contexts that are not DE (i.e. questions, modal verbs, imperatives,
directive propositional attitudes). This theory, augmented with the premise that certain PIs (i.e.
the liberal class represented by any) are subject to a weaker polarity dependency identified not
as LICENSING but as RESCUING by nonveridicality, explains the occurrence of this particular class
with only and emotive factive verbs. Crosslinguistic comparisons illustrate that the occurrence
of PIs with only and emotive factives is not a general phenomenon, and further support the dual
nature of polarity dependency and the semantic characterization of the elements that license or
rescue PIs.}}

	Abstract = {Within the framework of optimality theory (Prince & Smolensky 2004), Steriade (2001a,b)
proposes the P-map hypothesis, whose fundamental tenet is that the rankings of faithfulness
constraints are grounded in perceptual-similarity rankings. This article provides empirical support
for this hypothesis. In Japanese loanword phonology, a voiced geminate, but not a singleton,
devoices to dissimilate from another voiced obstruent within a single stem. Based on this observation,
I argue that the [ voice] feature is protected by two different faithfulness constraints,
IDENT( voi)Sing and IDENT( voi)Gem, and they are ranked as IDENT( voi)Sing >> IDENT( voi)Gem
in Japanese. I further argue that this ranking is grounded in the relative perceptibility of [ voice]
in singletons and geminates, and this claim is experimentally supported. The general theoretical
implication is that phonetic perceptibility can directly influence patterns in a phonological
grammar.}}

	Abstract = {A key mechanism in the organization of turns at talk in conversation is the ability to anticipate
or PROJECT the moment of completion of a current speaker's turn. Some authors suggest that this
is achieved via lexicosyntactic cues, while others argue that projection is based on intonational
contours. We tested these hypotheses in an on-line experiment, manipulating the presence of
symbolic (lexicosyntactic) content and intonational contour of utterances recorded in natural conversations.
When hearing the original recordings, subjects can anticipate turn endings with the
same degree of accuracy attested in real conversation. With intonational contour entirely removed
(leaving intact words and syntax, with a completely flat pitch), there is no change in subjects'
accuracy of end-of-turn projection. But in the opposite case (with original intonational contour
intact, but with no recognizable words), subjects' performance deteriorates significantly. These
results establish that the symbolic (i.e. lexicosyntactic) content of an utterance is necessary (and
possibly sufficient) for projecting the moment of its completion, and thus for regulating conversational
turn-taking. By contrast, and perhaps surprisingly, intonational contour is neither necessary
nor sufficient for end-of-turn projection.}}

	Abstract = {Children around age 2 acquiring Korean as a first language are well known for pro- 
ducing an error in which VP-internal material intervenes between the negator 
an and the verb, an order which is strictly ungrammatical in adult Korean. Children at the 
same age acquiring other languages make errors with subject case and with tense or 
agreement inflections on the verb, which has been analyzed by Wexler (1998) as 
stemming from a constraint on child grammars that prevents the subject from moving 
to two functional projections. The proposal here is that the child Korean errors result 
from the same constraint. This leads to an analysis of negation in adult Korean under 
which the VP material is base generated between the negator anand the verb, moving 
leftward in adult Korean. The child errors are then a result of omitting object-related 
functional projections that would drive this movement, paralleling Wexler's analysis 
of Optional Infinitives in other languages. The analysis presented here not only offers 
an explanation of the child errors but also constrains the possible analyses for negation 
in adult Korean in ways that are not obvious from the adult data alone.}}
